Abstract
We consider (✏, )-PAC maximum-selection and
ranking using pairwise comparisons for general
probabilistic models whose comparison probabilities satisfy strong stochastic transitivity and
stochastic triangle inequality. Modifying the
popular knockout tournament, we propose a
simple maximum-selection algorithm that uses
O ✏n2 1 + log 1 comparisons, optimal up to a
constant factor. We then derive a general framework that uses noisy binary search to speed up
many ranking algorithms, and combine it with
merge sort to obtain a ranking algorithm that uses
O ✏n2 log n(log log n)3 comparisons for = n1 ,
optimal up to a (log log n)3 factor.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
Maximum selection and sorting using pairwise comparisons are computer-science staples taught in most introductory classes and used in many applications. In fact, sorting,
also known as ranking, was once claimed to utilize 25% of
all computer cycles, e.g., (Mukherjee, 2011).
In many applications, the pairwise comparisons produce
only random outcomes. In sports, tournaments rank teams
based on pairwise matches whose outcomes are probabilistic in nature. For example, Microsoft’s TrueSkill (Herbrich
et al., 2006) software matches and ranks thousands of Xbox
gamers based on individual game results. And in online advertising, out of a myriad of possible ads, each web page
may display only a few, and a user will typically select at
most one. Based on these random comparisons, ad companies such as Google, Microsoft, or Yahoo, rank the ads’ appeal (Radlinski & Joachims, 2007; Radlinski et al., 2008).
These and related applications have brought about a resur1

gence of interest in maximum selection and ranking using noisy comparisons. Several probabilistic models
were considered, including the popular Bradley-TerryLuce (Bradley & Terry, 1952) and its Plackett-Luce (PL)
generalization (Plackett, 1975; Luce, 2005). Yet even for
such specific models, the number of pairwise comparisons
needed, or sample complexity, of maximum selection and
ranking was known only to within a log n factor. We consider a significantly broader class of models and yet propose algorithms that are optimal up to a constant factor for
maximum selection and up to (log log n)3 for ranking.
1.2. Notation
Noiseless comparison assumes an unknown underlying
ranking r(1), . . . ,r(n) of the elements in {1, . . . ,n} such
that if two elements are compared, the higher-ranked one
is selected. Similarly for noisy comparisons, we assume
an unknown ranking of the elements, but now if two elements i and j are compared, i is chosen with some unknown probability p(i, j) and j is chosen with probability p(j, i) = 1 p(i, j), where if i is higher-ranked, then
1
p(i, j)
2 . Repeated comparisons are independent of
each other.
Let p̃(i, j) = p(i, j) 12 reflect the additional probability
by which i is preferable to j. Note that p̃(j, i) = p̃(i, j)
and p̃(i, j) 0 if r(i) > r(j). |p̃(i, j)| can also be seen as
a measure of dissimilarity between i and j. Following (Yue
& Joachims, 2011), we assume that two natural properties, satisfied for example by the PL model, hold whenever
r(i) > r(j) > r(k): Strong Stochastic Transitivity (SST),
p̃(i, k) max(p̃(i, j), p̃(j, k)), and Stochastic Triangle Inequality (STI), p̃(i, k)  p̃(i, j) + p̃(j, k).
Two types of algorithms have been proposed for maximum selection and ranking under noisy comparisons: nonadaptive or offline (Rajkumar & Agarwal, 2014; Negahban
et al., 2012; 2016; Jang et al., 2016) where the comparison pairs are chosen in advance, and adaptive or online
where the comparison pairs are selected sequentially based
on previous comparison results. We focus on the latter.

We specify the desired output via the (✏, )-PAC
paradigm (Yue & Joachims, 2011; Szörényi et al., 2015)
that requires the output to likely closely approximate the
intended outcome. Specifically, given ✏, > 0, with prob-

ability

, maximum selection must output an ✏1
maximum element i such that for all j, p(i, j)
✏.
2
Similarly, with probability 1
, the ranking algorithm
must output an ✏-ranking r0 (1), . . . ,r0 (n) such that whenever r0 (i) > r0 (j), p(i, j) 12 ✏.
1.3. Outline
In Section 2 we review past work and summarize our
contributions. In Section 3 we describe and analyze our
maximum-selection algorithm. In Section 4 we propose
and evaluate the ranking algorithm. In Section 5 we experimentally compare our algorithms with existing ones. In
Section 6 we mention some future directions.

2. Old and new results
2.1. Related work
Several researchers studied algorithms that with probability 1
find the exact maximum and ranking. (Feige
et al., 1994) considered a simple model where the elements are ranked, and p̃(i, j) = ✏ whenever r(i) > r(j).
(Busa-Fekete et al., 2014a) considered comparison probabilities p(i, j) satisfying the Mallows model (Mallows,
1957). And (Urvoy et al., 2013; Busa-Fekete et al., 2014b;
Heckel et al., 2016) considered general comparison probabilities, without an underlying ranking assumption, and derived rankings based on Copeland- and Borda-counts, and
random-walk procedures. As expected, when the comparison probabilities approach half, the above algorithms require arbitrarily many comparisons.
To achieve finite complexity even with near-half comparison probabilities, researchers adopted the PAC paradigm.
For the PAC model with SST and STI constraints, (Yue &
Joachims, 2011) derived a maximum-selection algorithm
with sample complexity O ✏n2 log ✏n and used it to bound
the regret of the problem’s dueling-bandits variant. Related
results appeared in (Syrgkanis et al., 2016). For the PL
model, (Szörényi et al., 2015) derived a PAC ranking algorithm with sample complexity O( ✏n2 log n log ✏n ).
Deterministic adversarial versions of the problem were
considered by (Ajtai et al., 2015), and by (Acharya et al.,
2014a; 2016) who were motivated by density estimation (Acharya et al., 2014b).
2.2. New results
We consider (✏, )-PAC adaptive maximum selection and
ranking using pairwise comparisons under SST and STI

constraints. Note that when ✏

2 or
maximum selection and
1 1/n2 for ranking, any
output is correct. We show for ✏ < 1/4, < 12 and any n:

3. Maximum selection
3.1. Algorithm outline
We propose a simple maximum-selection algorithm based
on Knockout tournaments. Knockout tournaments are used
to find a maximum element under non-noisy comparisons.
Knockout tournament of n elements runs in dlog ne rounds
where in each round it randomly pairs the remaining elements and proceeds the winners to next round.
Our
algorithm,
given
in
K NOCKOUT
uses
O ✏n2 1 + log 1
comparisons and O(n) memory
to find an ✏-maximum. (Yue & Joachims, 2011) uses
O ✏n2 log ✏n comparisons and O(n2 ) memory to find an
✏-maximum. Hence we get log n-factor improvement in
the number of comparisons and also we use linear memory
compared to quadratic memory. From (Zhou & Chen,
2014) it can be inferred that the best PAC maximum selection algorithm requires ⌦ ✏n2 1 + log 1
comparisons,
hence up to constant factor, K NOCKOUT is optimal.
(Yue & Joachims, 2011; Szörényi et al., 2015) eliminate elements one by one until only ✏-maximums are remaining.
Since they potentially need n 1 eliminations, in order
to appply union bound they had to ensure that each eliminated element is not an ✏-maximum w.p. 1 /n, requiring
O(log(n/ )) comparisons for each eliminated element and
hence a superlinear sample complexity O(n log(n/ )).

In contrast, K NOCKOUT eliminates elements in log n
rounds. Since in Knockout tournaments, number of elements decrease exponentially with each round, we afford
to endure more error in the initial rounds and less error
in the latter rounds by repeating comparison between each
pair more times in latter rounds. Specifically, let bi be the
highest-ranked element (according to the unobserved underlying ranking) at the beginning of round i. K NOCKOUT
makes sure that w.p. 1 2i , p̃(bi , bi+1 )  ✏i by repeating

For
1, a relaxed notion of SST, called -stochastic

r(j) > r(k), then max(p̃(i, j), p̃(j, k))  · p̃(i, k). Our
results apply to this general notion of -stochastic transitivity and the analysis of K NOCKOUT
⇣ 4 is presented⌘ under
this model. K NOCKOUT uses O n✏2 1 + log 1
comparisons.
Remark 1. (Yue & Joachims, 2011) considered a different definition of ✏-maximum as an element i that is at most
✏ dissimilar to true maximum i.e., for j with r(j) = n,
p̃(j, i)  ✏. Note that this definition is less restrictive than
ours, hence requires fewer comparisons.

tion of K NOCKOUT shows that O n✏2 1 + log 1 comparisons suffice. Hence we also get a significant improvement in the exponent of .
To simplify the analysis, we assume that n is a power of
2, otherwise we can add 2dlog ne n dummy elements that
lose to every original element with probability 1. Note that
all ✏-maximums will still be from the original set.
3.2. Algorithm
We start with a subroutine C OMPARE that compares two
elements. It compares two elements i, j and maintains empirical probability p̂i , a proxy for p(i, j). It also maintains a
confidence value ĉ s.t., w.h.p., p̂i 2 (p(i, j) ĉ, p(i, j)+ ĉ).
C OMPARE stops if it is confident about the winner or if it
reaches its comparison budget m. It outputs the element
with more wins breaking ties randomly.
Algorithm 1 C OMPRARE
Input: element i, element j, bias ✏, confidence .
Initialize: pˆi = 12 , ĉ = 12 , m = 2✏12 log 2 , r = 0, wi = 0.

We show that C OMPARE w.h.p., outputs the correct winner
if the elements are well seperated.

Lemma 2. If p̃(i, j)

✏, then

P r(C OMPARE(i, j, ✏, ) 6= i)  .
Note that instead of using fixed number of comparisons,
C OMPARE stops the comparisons adaptively if it is confident about the winner. If |p̃(i, j)|
✏, C OMPARE stops
much before comparison budget 2✏12 log 2 and hence works
better in practice.
Now we present the subroutine K NOCKOUT-ROUND that
we use in main algorithm K NOCKOUT.
3.2.1. K NOCKOUT-ROUND
K NOCKOUT-ROUND takes a set S and outputs a set of size
|S|/2. It randomly pairs elements, compares each pair using C OMPARE, and returns the set of winners. We will later
show that maximum element in the output set will be comparable to maximum element in the input set.
Algorithm 2 K NOCKOUT-ROUND
Input: Set S, bias ✏, confidence .
Initialize: Set O = ;.
1. Pair elements in S randomly.
2. for every pair (i, j):
Add C OMPARE(i, j, ✏, ) to O.
Output: O
Note that comparisons between each pair can be handled
by a different processor and hence this algorithm can be
easily parallelized.
S can have several maximum elements. Comparison probabilities corresponding to all maximum elements will be
essentially same because of STI. We define max(S) to be
the maximum element with the least index, namely,

max(S) = S min{i : p̃(S(i), S(j)) 0 8j} .

3.2.2. K NOCKOUT
Now we present the main algorithm K NOCKOUT. K NOCK OUT takes an input set S and runs log n rounds of
K NOCKOUT-ROUND halving the size of S at the end of
each round. Recall that K NOCKOUT-ROUND makes sure
that maximum element in the output set is comparable to

Maximum Selection and Ranking under Noisy Comparisons

maximum element in the input set. Using this, K NOCK OUT makes sure that the output element is comparable to
maximum element in the input set.
Since the size of S gets halved after each round, K NOCK OUT compares each pair more times in the latter rounds.
Hence the bias between maximum element in input set and
maximum element in output set is small in latter rounds.

Input: Set S, bias ✏, confidence , stochasticity .

Note that K NOCKOUT uses only memory of set S and
hence O(n) memory suffices.

Theorem 4 shows that K NOCKOUT outputs an ✏-maximum
with probability

comparisons used by the algorithm.

Notice that we use only Õ n log

✏2

where as (Szörényi et al., 2015) uses O n(log n)2 /✏2
comparisons even for constant error probability . Furthermore (Szörényi et al., 2015) provided these guarantees
only under Plackett-Luce model which is more restrictive
compared to ours. Also, their algorithm uses O(n2 ) memory compared to O(n) memory requirement of ours.

Our main algorithm B INARY-S EARCH -R ANKING assumes
the existence of a ranking algorithm R ANK -x that with
probability at least 1
uses O ✏n2 (log n)x log n comparisons and outputs an ✏-ranking for any > 0, ✏ > 0 and
some x > 1. We also present a R ANK -x algorithm with
x = 3.
Observe that we need R ANK -x algorithm to work for any
model that satisfies SST and STI. (Szörényi et al., 2015)
showed that their algorithm works for Plackett-Luce model
but not for more general model. So we present a R ANK -x

algorithm that works for general model.
The main algorithm B INARY-S EARCH -R ANKING randomly selects (lognn)x elements (anchors) and rank them
using R ANK -x . The algorithm has then effectively created (lognn)x bins, each between two successively ranked
anchors. Then for each element, the algorithm identifies
the bin it belongs to using a noisy binary search algorithm.
The algorithm then ranks the elements within each bin using R ANK -x .
We first present M ERGE -R ANK, a R ANK -3 algorithm.
4.1. Merge Ranking
We present
ranking
algorithm M ERGE -R ANK that
⇣ a simple
⌘

uses O
log
comparisons, O(n) memory and
✏2
with probability
1
outputs an ✏-ranking. Thus
M ERGE -R ANK is a R ANK -x algorithm for x = 3.
Similar to Merge Sort, M ERGE -R ANK divides the elements
into two sets of equal size, ranks them separately and combines the sorted sets. Due to the noisy nature of comparisons, M ERGE -R ANK compares two elements i, j sufficient times, so that the comparison output is correct with
✏
high probability when |p̃(i, j)|
log n . Put differently,
M ERGE -R ANK is same as the typical Merge Sort, except it
uses C OMPARE as the comparison function. Due to lack of
space, M ERGE -R ANK is presented in Appendix A.
Let’s define the error of an ordered set S as the maximum
distance between two wrongly ordered items in S, namely,
def

err(S) =

max

1ij|S|

p̃(S(i), S(j)).

We show that when we merge two ordered sets, the error of
the resulting ordered set will be at most log✏ n more than the
maximum of errors of individual ordered sets.
Observe that M ERGE -R ANK is a recursive algorithm and
the error of a singleton set is 0. Two singleton sets each
containing a unique element from the input set merge to
2✏
form a set with two elements with an error at most log
n,
then two sets with two elements merge to form a set with
3✏
four elements with an error of at most log
n and henceforth.
Thus the error of the output ordered set is bounded by ✏.
Lemma 5 shows that M ERGE -R ANK can output an ✏ranking of S with probability 1
. It also bounds the
number of comparisons used by the algorithm.

Now we present our main ranking algorithm.

4.2. B INARY-S EARCH -R ANKING
We first sketch the algorithm outline below. We then provide a proof outline.
4.2.1. A LGORITHM OUTLINE

1. Form a set S 0 with (lognn)x random elements from

Creating anchors: (Steps 1 to 3) B INARY-S EARCH R ANKING first selects a set S 0 of (lognn)x random elements
(anchors) and ranks them using R ANK -x . At the end of
this part, there are (lognn)x ranked anchors. Equivalently,
1 bins, each bin between
the algorithm creates (lognn)x
two successively ranked anchors.

2. Rank S 0 using R ANK -x S 0 , ✏0 , n16 .

Coarse ranking: (Step 4) After forming the bins, the algorithm uses a random walk on a binary search tree, to find
which bin each element belongs to. I NTERVAL -B INARYS EARCH is similar to the noisy binary search algorithm
in (Feige et al., 1994). It builds a binary search tree with the
bins as the leaves and it does a random walk over this tree.
Due to lack of space the algorithm I NTERVAL -B INARYS EARCH is presented in Appendix B but more intuition is
given later in this section.

Ranking within each bin: (Step 5) For each bin, we
show that the number of elements far from both anchors
is bounded. The algorithm checks elements inside a bin
whether they are close to any of the bin’s anchors. For
the elements that are close to anchors, the algorithm ranks
them close to the anchor. And for the elements that are
away from both anchors the algorithm ranks them using
R ANK -x and outputs the resulting ranking.
4.2.2. A NALYSIS OF B INARY-S EARCH -R ANKING
Creating anchors In Step 1 of the algorithm we select
n/(log n)x random elements. Since these are chosen uniformly random, they lie nearly uniformly in the set S. This
intuition is formalized in the next lemma.
Lemma 6. Consider a set S of n elements. If we select
n
(log n)x elements uniformly randomly from S and build an
ordered set S 0 s.t. p̃(S 0 (i), S 0 (j))

to a bin if it wins over the bin’s left anchor with probability

with probability < 12 and thus not belong to any bin. So in
0
Step 3, we add a dummy element a at
Sthe0 beginning of S
where a loses to every element in S S with probability
1. For similar reasons we add a dummy
S element b to the
end of S 0 where every element in S S 0 loses to b with
probability 1.

Coarse Ranking Note that S 0 (i) and S 0 (i + 1) are respec|{e 2 S : p̃(e, S 0 (k)) > ✏, p̃(S 0 (k+1), e) > ✏}|  5(log n)x+1 .

In Step 2, we use R ANK -x to rank S 0 . Lemma 7 shows the
guarantee of ranking S 0 .
Lemma 7. After Step 2 of the B INARY-S EARCH R ANKING with probability 1 n16 , S 0 is ✏0 -ranked.
At the end of Step 2, we have (lognn)x 1 bins, each between two successively ranked anchors. Each bin has a left

S EARCH ran for at most 30 log n steps, Q can have at most
60 log n elements and hence B INARY-S EARCH can search
effectively by repeating each comparison O(log n) times
to maintain high confidence. Next paragraph explains how
B INARY-S EARCH finds such an element f .

In Step 4, for each element we find an ✏00 -nearly correct bin
using I NTERVAL -B INARY-S EARCH . Next we describe an
outline of I NTERVAL -B INARY-S EARCH.

B INARY-S EARCH first compares e with the middle element m of Q for O(log n) times. If the fraction of
wins for e is between 12
3✏00 and 12 + 3✏00 , then w.h.p.
00
|p̃(e, m)|  4✏ and hence B INARY-S EARCH outputs m.
If the fraction of wins for e is less than 12 3✏00 , then w.h.p.
p̃(e, m)  2✏00 and hence it eliminates all elements to the
right of m in Q. If the fraction of wins for e is more than
1
00
2✏00 and hence it eliminates
2 + 3✏ , then w.h.p. p̃(e, m)
all elements to the left of m in Q. It continues this process
until it finds an element f such that the fraction of wins for
e is between 12 3✏00 and 12 + 3✏00 .

I NTERVAL -B INARY-S EARCH first builds a binary search
tree of intervals (see Appendix B) as follows: the root node
is the entire interval between the first and the last elements
in S 0 . Each non-leaf node interval I has two children corresponding to the left and right halves of I. The leaves of the
tree are the bins between two successively ranked anchors.
To find an ✏00 -nearly correct bin for an element e, the algorithm starts at the root of the binary search tree and at every
non-leaf node corresponding to interval I, it checks if e belongs to I or not by comparing e with I’s left and right
anchors. If e loses to left anchor or wins against the right
anchor, the algorithm backtracks to current node’s parent.
If e wins against I’s left anchor and loses to its right one,
the algorithm checks if e belongs to the left or right child
by comparing e with the middle element of I and moves
accordingly.
When at a leaf node, the algorithm checks if e belongs to
the bin by maintaining a counter. If e wins against the bin’s
left anchor and loses to the bin’s right anchor, it increases
the counter by one or otherwise it decreases the counter by
one. If the counter is less than 0 the algorithm backtracks
to the bin’s parent. By repeating each comparison several
times, the algorithm makes a correct decision with probability 19
20 .
Note that there could be several ✏00 -nearly correct bins for
e and even though at each step the algorithm moves in the
direction of one of them, it could end up moving in a loop
and never reaching one of them. We thus run the algorithm
for 30 log n steps and terminate.
If the algorithm is at a leaf node by 30 log n steps and the
counter is more than 10 log n we show that the leaf node bin
is a ✏00 -nearly correct bin for e and the algorithm outputs
the leaf node. If not, the algorithm puts in a set Q all the
anchors visited so far and orders Q according to S 0 .
We select 30 log n steps to ensure that if there is only one
nearly correct bin, then the algorithm outputs that bin w.p.
1 n16 . Also we do not want too many steps so as to
bound the size of Q.
By doing a simple binary search in Q using B INARYS EARCH (see Appendix B) we find an anchor f 2 Q
such that |p̃(e, f )|  4✏00 . Since I NTERVAL -B INARY-

In next Lemma, we show that I NTERVAL -B INARYS EARCH achieves to find a 5✏00 -nearly correct bin for every
element.
Lemma 8. For any element e 2 S, Step 4 of
B INARY-S EARCH -R ANKING places e in bin Sl such that
p̃(e, S 0 (l)) > 5✏00 and p̃(S 0 (l + 1), e) > 5✏00 with probability 1 n15 .
Ranking within each bin Once we have identified the bins,
we rank the elements inside each bin. By Lemma 6, inside
each bin all elements are close to the bin’s anchors except
at most 5(log n)x+1 of them.
The algorithm finds the elements close to anchors in Step
5a by comparing each element in the bin with the bin’s
anchors. If an element in bin Sj is close to bin’s anchors
S 0 (j) or S 0 (j + 1) , the algorithm moves it to the set Cj
or Cj+1 accordingly and if it is far away from both, the algorithm moves it to the set Bj . The following two lemmas
state that this separating process happens accurately with
high probability. The proofs of these results follow from
the Chernoff bound and hence omitted.
Lemma 9. At the end of Step 5a, for all j, 8e 2 Cj ,
|p̃(e, S 0 (j))| < 7✏00 with probability 1 n13 .
Lemma 10. At the end of Step 5a, for all j, 8e 2 Bj ,
min(p̃(e, S 0 (j)), p̃(S 0 (j + 1), e)) > 5✏00 with probability
1 n13 .
Combining Lemmas 6, 7 and 10 next lemma shows that the
size of Bj is bounded for all j.
Lemma 11. At the end of Step 5a, |Bj |  5(log n)x+1 for
all j, with probability 1 n33 .
Since all the elements in Cj are already close to an anchor, they need not be ranked. By Lemma 11 with probability
1 n33 the number of elements in Bj is at most
x+1
5(log n)
. We use R ANK -x to rank each Bj and output
the final ranking.

Lemma 12 shows that all Bj ’s are ✏00 -ranked at the end of
Step 5b. Proof follows from properties of R ANK -x and

5. Experiments
We compare the performance of our algorithms with that
of others over simulated data. Similar to (Yue & Joachims,
2011), we consider the stochastic model where p(i, j) =
0.6 8i < j. Note that this model satisfies both SST and STI.
We find 0.05-maximum with error probability = 0.1. Observe that i = 1 is the only 0.05-maximum. We compare
the sample complexity of K NOCKOUT with that of BTMPAC (Yue & Joachims, 2011), MallowsMPI (Busa-Fekete
et al., 2014a), and AR (Heckel et al., 2016). BTM-PAC is
an (✏, )-PAC algorithm for the same model considered in
this paper. MallowsMPI finds a Condorcet winner which
exists under our general model. AR finds the maximum according to Borda scores. We also tried PLPAC (Szörényi
et al., 2015), developed originally for PL model but the algorithm could not meet guarantees of = 0.1 under this

model and hence omitted. Note that in all the experiments
the reported numbers are averaged over 100 runs.
In Figure 1, we compare the sample complexity of algorithms when there are 7, 10 and 15 elements. Our algorithm outperforms all the others. BTM-PAC performs
much worse in comparison to others because of high constants in the algorithm. Further BTM-PAC allows comparing an element with itself since the main objective in
(Yue & Joachims, 2011) is to reduce the regret. We exclude
BTM-PAC for further experiments with higher number of
elements.
In Figure 2, we compare the algorithms when there are 50,
100, 200 and 500 elements. Our algorithm outperforms
others for higher number of elements too. Performance of
AR gets worse as the number of elements increases since
Borda scores of the elements get closer to each other and
hence AR takes more comparisons to eliminate an element.
Notice that number of comparisons is in logarithmic scale
and hence the performance of MallowsMPI appears to be
close to that of ours.
As noted in (Szörényi et al., 2015), sample complexity of
MallowsMPI gets worse as p̃(i, j) gets close to 0. To

Figure 4. Sample complexity of K NOCKOUT and MallowsMPI

show the pronounced effect, we use the stochastic model
p(1, j) = 0.6 8j > 1, p(i, j) = 0.5 + q̃ 8j > i, i > 1
where q̃ < 0.1, and the number of elements is 15. Here too
we find 0.05-maximum with = 0.1. Note that i = 1 is
the only 0.05-maximum in this stochastic model. In Figure 3, we compare the algorithms for different values of
q̃: 0.01, 0.005 and 0.001. As discussed above, the performance of MallowsMPI gets much worse whereas our
algorithm’s performance stays unchanged. The reason is
that MallowsMPI finds the Condorcet winner using successive elimination technique and as q̃ gets closer to 0,
MallowsMPI takes more comparisons for each elimination. Our algorithm tries to find an alternative which defeats Condorcet winner with probability 0.5 0.05 and
hence for alternatives that are very close to each other, our
algorithm declares either one of them as winner after comparing them for certain number of times.
Next we evaluate K NOCKOUT on Mallows model which
does not satisfy STI. Mallows is a parametric model which
is specified by single parameter . As in (Busa-Fekete
et al., 2014a), we consider n = 10 elements and various
values for : 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95 and 0.99.
Here again we seek to find 0.05-maximum with = 0.05.

Figure 5. Sample complexity of M ERGE -R ANK for different ✏

As we can see in Figure 4, sample complexity of K NOCK OUT and MallowsMPI is essentially same under small values of but K NOCKOUT outperforms MallowsMPI as
gets close to 1 since comparison probabilities grow closer
to 1/2. Surprisingly, for all values of except for 0.99,
K NOCKOUT returned Condorcet winner in all runs. For
= 0.99, K NOCKOUT returned second best element in 10
runs out of 100. Note that p̃(1, 2) = 0.0025 and hence
K NOCKOUT still outputed a 0.05-maximum. Even though
we could not show theoretical guarantees of K NOCKOUT
under Mallows model, our simulations suggest that it can
perform well even under this model.
For the stochastic model p(i, j) = 0.6 8i < j, we run
our M ERGE -R ANK algorithm to find an ✏-ranking with
= 0.1. Figure 5 shows that sample complexity does not
increase a lot with decreasing ✏. We attribute this to the
subroutine C OMPARE that finds the winner faster when the
elements are more dissimilar.
Some more experiments are provided in Appendix G.

6. Conclusion
We studied maximum selection and ranking using noisy
comparisons for broad comparison models satisfying SST
and STI. For maximum selection we presented a simple
algorithm with linear, hence optimal, sample complexity.
For ranking we presented a framework that improves the
performance of many ranking algorithms and applied it to
merge ranking to derive a near-optimal algorithm.
We conducted several experiments showing that our algorithms perform well and out-perform existing algorithms
on simulated data.
The maximum-selection experiments suggest that our algorithm performs well even without STI. It would be of interest to extend our theoretical guarantees to this case. For
ranking, it would be interesting to close the (log log n)3 ratio between the upper- and lower- complexity bounds.
