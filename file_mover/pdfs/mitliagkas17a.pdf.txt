Improving Gibbs Sampler Scan Quality with DoGS
Ioannis Mitliagkas 1 Lester Mackey 2

Abstract
The pairwise influence matrix of Dobrushin has
long been used as an analytical tool to bound the
rate of convergence of Gibbs sampling. In this
work, we use Dobrushin influence as the basis
of a practical tool to certify and efficiently improve the quality of a discrete Gibbs sampler. Our
Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers (DoGS) offer customized variable selection orders for a
given sampling budget and variable subset of interest, explicit bounds on total variation distance
to stationarity, and certifiable improvements over
the standard systematic and uniform random scan
Gibbs samplers. In our experiments with joint image segmentation and object recognition, Markov
chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation, and Ising model inference, DoGS consistently deliver higher-quality inferences with significantly smaller sampling budgets than standard
Gibbs samplers.

1. Introduction
The Gibbs sampler of Geman & Geman (1984), also known
as the Glauber dynamics or the heat-bath algorithm, is a
leading Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for approximating expectations unavailable in closed form. First
detailed as a technique for restoring degraded images (Geman & Geman, 1984), Gibbs sampling has since found
diverse applications in statistical physics (Janke, 2008),
stochastic optimization and parameter estimation (Geyer,
1991), and Bayesian inference (Lunn et al., 2000).
The hallmark of any Gibbs sampler is conditional simulation: individual variables are successively simulated from
the univariate conditionals of a multivariate target distribu1

tion. The principal degree of freedom is the scan, the order
in which variables are sampled (He et al., 2016). While it
is common to employ a systematic scan, sweeping through
each variable in turn, or a uniform random scan, sampling
each variable with equal frequency, it is known that nonuniform scans can lead to more accurate inferences both in
theory and in practice (Liu et al., 1995; Levine & Casella,
2006). This effect is particularly pronounced when certain
variables are of greater inferential interest. Past approaches
to optimizing Gibbs sampler scans were based on asymptotic quality measures approximated with the output of a
Markov chain (Levine et al., 2005; Levine & Casella, 2006).
In this work, we propose a computable non-asymptotic scan
quality measure for discrete target distributions based on Dobrushin’s notion of variable influence (Dobrushin & Shlosman, 1985). We show that for a given subset of variables,
this Dobrushin variation (DV) bounds the marginal total
variation between a target distribution and T steps of Gibbs
sampling with a specified scan. More generally, Dobrushin
variation bounds a weighted total variation based on userinputted importance weights for each variable. We couple
this quality measure with an efficient procedure for optimizing scan quality by minimizing Dobrushin variation.
Our Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers (DoGS) come
equipped with a guaranteed bound on scan quality, are never
worse than the standard uniform random and systematic
scans, and can be tailored to a target number of sampling
steps and a subset of target variables. Moreover, Dobrushin
variation can be used to evaluate and compare the quality of any user-specified set of scans prior to running any
expensive simulations.
The improvements achieved by DoGS are driven by an inputted matrix, C̄, of pairwise variable influence bounds
discussed in more detail in Section 3. While DoGS can
be used with any discrete distribution, it was designed for
targets with total influence kC̄k < 1, measured in any matrix norm. This criterion is known to hold for a variety of
distributions, including Ising models with sufficiently high
temperatures, hard-core lattice gas models, random graph
colorings (Hayes, 2006), and classes of weighted constraint
satisfaction problems (Feng et al., 2017). Moreover, as we
will see in Section 4.1, suitable variable influence bounds
are readily available for pairwise and binary Markov random fields. These user-friendly bounds give rise to total

influence kC̄k < 1 in all of our experiments and thereby
enable improvements in both inferential speed and accuracy
over standard scans.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews Gibbs sampling and standard but computationally intractable measures of Gibbs sampler quality.
In Section 3, we introduce our scan quality measure and
its relationship to (weighted) total variation. We describe
our procedures for selecting high-quality Gibbs sampler
scans in Section 4. In Section 5, we apply our techniques
to three popular applications of the Gibbs sampler: joint
image segmentation and object recognition, MCMC maximum likelihood estimation with intractable gradients, and
inference in the Ising model. In each case, we observe
substantial improvements in full or marginal total variation
over standard scans. Section 6 presents our conclusions and
discussion of future work.
Notation For any vector v and index i, we let v i represent
the subvector of v with entry vi removed. We use diag(v)
for a square diagonal matrix with v on the diagonal and
for element-wise multiplication. The i-th standard basis
vector is denoted by ei , I represents an identity matrix, 1
signifies a vector of ones, and kCk is the spectral norm of
matrix C. We use the shorthand [p] , {1, . . . , p}.

2. Gibbs sampling and total variation
Consider a target distribution ⇡ on a finite p-dimensional
state space, X p . Our inferential goal is to approximate expectations – means, moments, marginals,
and more complex
P
function averages, E⇡ [f (X)] = x2X p ⇡(x)f (x) – under
⇡, but we assume that both exact computation and direct
sampling from ⇡ are prohibitive due to the large number
of states, |X |p . Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms attempt to skirt this intractability by simulating a
sequence of random vectors X 0 , X 1 , . . . , X T 2 X p from
tractable distributions such that expectations over X T are
close to expectations under ⇡.
2.1. Gibbs sampling
Algorithm 1 summarizes the specific recipe employed by
the Gibbs sampler (Geman & Geman, 1984), a leading
MCMC algorithm which successively simulates single variables from their tractable conditional distributions. The principal degree of freedom in a Gibbs sampler is the scan, the
sequence of p-dimensional probability vectors q1 , . . . , qT
determining the probability of resampling each variable on
each round of Gibbs sampling. Typically one selects between the uniform random scan, qt = (1/p, . . . , 1/p) for all
t, where variable indices are selected uniformly at random
on each round and the systematic scan, qt = e(t mod p)+1
for each t, which repeatedly cycles through each variable

in turn. However, non-uniform scans are known to lead to
better approximations (Liu et al., 1995; Levine & Casella,
2006), motivating the need for practical procedures for evaluating and improving Gibbs sampler scans.
2.2. Total variation
Let ⇡t represent the distribution of the t-th step, X t , of a
Gibbs sampler. The quality of a T -step Gibbs sampler and
its scan is typically measured in terms of total variation (TV)
distance between ⇡T and the target distribution ⇡:

kµ

⌫kT V ,

sup
f :X p ![0,1]

E⌫ [f (Y )]|.

|Eµ [f (X)]

We view TV as providing a bound on the bias of a large
class of Gibbs sampler expectations; note, however, that TV
does not control the variance of these expectations.
2.3. Marginal and weighted total variation
While we typically sample all p variables in the process of
Gibbs sampling, it is common for some variables to be of
greater interest than others. For example, when modeling
a large particle system, we may be interested principally in
the behavior in local region of the system; likewise, when
segmenting an image into its component parts, a particular
region, like the area surrounding a face, is often of primary
interest. In these cases, it is more natural to consider a
marginal total variation that measures the discrepancy in
expectation over only those variables of interest.
Definition 2 (Marginal total variation). The marginal total
variation between probability measures µ and ⌫ on a subset
of variables S 2 [p] is the maximum difference in expectations over all [0, 1]-valued functions of X S , the restriction
of X to the coordinates in S:

More generally, we will seek to control an arbitrary userdefined weighted total variation that assigns an independent
non-negative weight to each variable and hence controls the
approximation error for functions with varying sensitivities
in each variable.

Definition 6 (Dobrushin influence matrix). The Dobrushin
influence of variable j on variable i is given by

Definition 3 (d-bounded differences). We say f : X p ! R
has d-bounded differences for d 2 Rd if, for all X, Y 2 X p ,

where (X, Y ) 2 Nj signifies Xl = Yl for all l 6= j.

For example, every function with range [0, 1] is a 1Lipschitz feature, and the value of the first variable, x 7! x1 ,
is an e1 -Lipschitz feature. This definition leads to a measure
of sample quality tailored to d-bounded difference functions.
Definition 4 (d-weighted total variation). The d-weighted
total variation between probability measures µ and ⌫ is
the maximum difference in expectations across d-bounded
difference functions:

3. Measuring scan quality with Dobrushin
variation
Since the direct computation of total variation measures
is typically prohibitive, we will define an efficiently computable upper bound on the weighted total variation of Definition 4. Our construction is inspired by the Gibbs sampler
convergence analysis of Dobrushin & Shlosman (1985).
The first step in Dobrushin’s approach is to control total
variation in terms of coupled random vectors, (Xt , Yt )Tt=0 ,
where X t has the distribution, ⇡t , of the t-th step of the
Gibbs sampler and Y t follows the target distribution ⇡. For
any such coupling, we can define the marginal coupling
probability pt,i , P(Xit 6= Yit ). The following lemma, a
generalization of results in (Dobrushin & Shlosman, 1985;
Hayes, 2006), shows that weighted total variation is controlled by these marginal coupling probabilities. The proof
is given in Appendix A.1, and similar arguments can be
found in Rebeschini & van Handel (2014).

This influence matrix is at the heart of our efficiently computable measure of scan quality, Dobrushin variation.
Definition 7 (Dobrushin variation). For any nonnegative
weight vector d 2 Rp and entrywise upper bound C̄ on the
Dobrushin influence (1), we define the Dobrushin variation
of a scan (qt )Tt=1 as
V(q1 , . . . , qT ; d, C̄) , d> B(qT ) · · · B(q1 )1
for B(q) , (I

diag(q)(I

C̄)).

Theorem 8 shows that Dobrushin variation dominates
weighted TV and thereby provides target- and scan-specific
guarantees on the weighted TV quality of a Gibbs sampler.
The proof in Appendix A.2 rests on the fact that, for each
t, bt , B(qt ) · · · B(q1 )1 provides an elementwise upper
bound on the vector of marginal coupling probabilities, pt .
Theorem 8 (Dobrushin variation controls weighted TV).
Suppose that ⇡T is the distribution of the T -th step of a
Gibbs sampler with scan (qt )Tt=1 . Then, for any nonnegative
weight vector d 2 Rp and entrywise upper bound C̄ on the

We next present an efficient algorithm for improving the
quality of any Gibbs sampler scan by minimizing Dobrushin
variation. We will refer to the resulting customized Gibbs
samplers as Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers or DoGS
for short. Algorithm 2 optimizes Dobrushin variation using
coordinate descent, with the selection distribution qt for
each time step serving as a coordinate. Since Dobrushin
variation is linear in each qt , each coordinate optimization
(in the absence of ties) selects a degenerate distribution, a
single coordinate, yielding a fully deterministic scan. If
m  p is a bound on the size of the Markov blanket of
each variable, then our forward-backward algorithm runs
in time O(kdk0 + min(m log p + m2 , p)T ) with O(p + T )
storage for deterministic input scans. The T (m log p + m2 )
term arises from maintaining the derivative vector, w, in an
efficient sorting structure, like a max-heap.

Dobrushin’s second step is to control the marginal coupling
probabilities pt in terms of influence, a measure of how
much a change in variable j affects the conditional distribution of variable i.

A user can initialize DoGS with any baseline scan, including
a systematic or uniform random scan, and the resulting
customized scan is guaranteed to have the same or better
Dobrushin variation. Moreover, DoGS scans will always

which shows that Dobrushin variation—and hence the dweighted total variation by Theorem 8—goes to 0 under

4.1. Bounding influence
An essential input to our algorithms is the entrywise upper
bound C̄ on the influence matrix (1). Fortunately, Liu &

particularly straightforward to compute for any pairwise

A general parameterization for binary pairwise MRFs is

An exact computation of Cij would replace the cutoff of 1

So far, we have focused on bounding influence in pairwise
MRFs, as these bounds are most relevant to our experiments;
indeed, in Section 5, we will use DoGS in conjunction with
the bounds of Theorems 10 and 11 to improve scan quality
for a variety of inferential tasks. However, user-friendly
bounds are also available for non-pairwise MRFs (note that
any discrete distribution can be represented as an MRF with
parameters in the extended reals), and we include a simple
extension of Theorem 11 that applies to binary MRFs with
higher-order interactions. Its proof is in Appendix A.5

4.2. Related Work

Levine & Casella (2006) approximate these Minimax Adaptive Scans for specific mixture models by considering single
ad hoc features of interest; the approach has many hyperparameters to tune including the order of the Taylor expansion approximation, which sample points are used to approximate asymptotic quantities online, and the frequency
of adaptive updating. Our proposed quality measure, Dobrushin variation, requires no approximation or tuning and
can be viewed as a practical non-asymptotic objective function for the abstract scan selection framework of Levine and
Casella. In the spirit of (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2011), DoGS
can also be viewed as an approximate inference scheme
calibrated for downstream inferential tasks depending only
on subsets of variables.
Levine et al. (2005) employ the Minimax Adaptive Scans of
Levine and Casella by finding the mode of their target distribution using EM and then approximating the distribution by
a Gaussian. They report that this approach to scan selection
introduces substantial computational overhead (10 minutes
of computation for an Ising model with 64 variables). As we
will see in Section 5, the overhead of DoGS scan selection is
manageable (15 seconds of computation for an Ising model
with 1 million variables) and outweighed by the increase in
scan quality and sampling speed.

5. Experiments
In this section, we demonstrate how our proposed scan quality measure and efficient optimization schemes can be used
to both evaluate and improve Gibbs sampler scans when
either the full distribution or a marginal distribution is of
principal interest. For all experiments with binary MRFs, we
adopt the model parameterization of (3) (with no additional
temperature parameter) and use Theorem 11 to produce the
Dobrushin influence bound C̄. On all ensuing plots, the
numbers in the legend state the best guarantee achieved for
each algorithm plotted. Due to space constraints, we display
only one representative plot per experiment; the analogous
plots from independent replicates of each experiment can
be found in Appendix B.

101
TV guarantee

In related work, Latuszynski et al. (2013) recently analyzed
an abstract class of adaptive Gibbs samplers parameterized
by an arbitrary scan selection rule. However, as noted in
their Rem. 5.13, no explicit scan selection rules were provided in that paper. The only prior concrete scan selection
rules of which we are aware are the Minimax Adaptive
Scans with asymptotic variance or convergence rate objective functions (Levine & Casella, 2006). Unless some
substantial approximation is made, it is unclear how to implement these procedures when the target distribution of
interest is not Gaussian.

Figure 1. TV guarantees provided Dobrushin variation for various
Gibbs sampler scans on a 10 ⇥ 10 non-toroidal Ising model with
random parameters (see Section 5.1). DoGS is initialized with the
systematic scan.

5.1. Evaluating and optimizing Gibbs sampler scans
In our first experiment, we illustrate how Dobrushin variation can be used to select between standard scans and how
DoGS can be used to efficiently improve upon standard scan
quality when total variation quality is of interest. We remind
the reader that both scan evaluation and scan selection are
performed offline prior to any expensive simulation from
the Gibbs sampler. Our target is a 10 ⇥ 10 Ising model
arranged in a two-dimensional lattice, a standard model of
ferromagnetism in statistical physics. In the notation of (3),
we draw the unary parameters ✓i uniformly at random from
{0, 1}, and the interaction parameters uniformly at random:
✓ij ⇠ Uniform([0, 0.25]).

Figure 1 compares, as a function of the number of steps T ,
the total variation guarantee provided by Dobrushin variation (see Theorem 8) for the standard systematic and uniform random scans. We see that the systematic scan, which
traverses variables in row major order, obtains a significantly
better TV guarantee than its uniform random counterpart for
all sampling budgets T . Hence, the systematic scan would
be our standard scan of choice for this target. DoGS (Algorithm 2) initialized with d = 1 and the systematic scan further improves the systematic scan guarantee by two orders
of magnitude. Iterating Algorithm 2 on its own scan output
until convergence (“Iterated DoGS” in Figure 1) provides
additional improvement. However, since we consistently
find that the bulk of the improvement is obtained with a
single run of Algorithm 2, non-iterated DoGS remains our
recommended recipe for quickly improving scan quality.
Note that since our TV guarantee is an upper bound provided
by the exact computation of Dobrushin variation, the actual
gains in TV may differ from the gains in Dobrushin variation.
In practice and as evidenced in Section 5.4, we find that
the actual gains in (marginal) TV over standard scans are
typically larger than the Dobrushin variation gains.

5.2. End-to-end wall clock time performance
In this experiment, we demonstrate that using DoGS to
optimize a scan can result in dramatic inferential speed-ups.
This effect is particularly pronounced for targets with a large
number of variables and in settings that require repeated
sampling from a low-bias Gibbs sampler. The setting is
the exactly same as in the previous experiment, with the
exception of model size: here we simulate a 103 ⇥ 103 Ising
model, with 1 million variables in total. We target a single
marginal X1 with d = e1 and take a systematic scan of
length T = 2 ⇥ 106 as our input scan. After measuring
the Dobrushin variation ✏ of the systematic scan, we use
an efficient length-doubling scheme to select a DoGS scan:
(0) initialize T̃ = 2; (1) run Algorithm 2 with the first T̃
steps of the systematic scan as input; (2) if the resulting
DoGS scan has Dobrushin variation less than ✏, we keep it;
otherwise we double T̃ and return to step (1). The resulting
DoGS scan has length T̃ = 16.

by Domke or from DoGS initialized with the uniform random scan,
using Algorithm 2 to achieve a target total variation of 0.01 (see
Section 5.3). Five runs are shown in each case.

We repeatedly draw independent sample points from either
the length T systematic scan Gibbs sampler or the length T̃

the resulting Monte Carlo estimates of E⇡ [X1 ] as a function

scans when processing a 64 variable Ising model. The bottom plot of Figure 2 uses the average measured time for a
single step1 , the measured setup time for DoGS and the size
of the two scan sequences to give an estimate of the speedup
as a function of the number of sample points drawn. Additional timing experiments are deferred to Appendix B.2.
5.3. Accelerated MCMC maximum likelihood
estimation
We next illustrate how DoGS can be used to accelerate
MCMC maximum likelihood estimation, while providing
guarantees on parameter estimation quality. We replicate

5.4. Customized scans for fast marginal mixing
In this section we demonstrate how DoGS can be used to
dramatically speed up marginal inference while providing
target-dependent guarantees. We use a 40 ⇥ 40 non-toroidal
Ising model and set our feature to be the top left variable
with d = e1 . Figure 4 compares guarantees for a uniform
random scan and a systematic scan; we also see how we can
further improve the total variation guarantees by feeding a
systematic scan into Algorithm 2. Again we see that a single
run of Algorithm 2 yields the bulk of the improvement, and
iterated applications only provide small further benefits. For
the DoGS sequence, the figure also shows a histogram of
the distance of sampled variables from the target variable,
X1 , at the top left corner of the grid.
Figure 5 shows that optimizing our objective actually improves performance by reducing the marginal bias much
more quickly than systematic scan. For completeness, we
include additional experiments on a toroidal Ising model in
Appendix B.3.
5.5. Targeted image segmentation and object
recognition
The Markov field aspect model (MFAM) of Verbeek &
Triggs (2007) is a generative model for images designed
to automatically divide an image into its constituent parts
(image segmentation) and label each part with its semantic
object class (object recognition). For each test image k,
the MFAM extracts a discrete feature descriptor from each
image patch i, assigns a latent object class label Xi 2 X to

the Ising model maximum likelihood estimation experiment
of (Domke, 2015, Sec. 6) and show how we can provide
the same level of accuracy faster. Our aim is to learn the
parameters of binary MRFs based on training samples with
independent Rademacher entries. On each step of MCMCMLE, Domke uses Gibbs sampling with a uniform random
scan to produce an estimate of the gradient of the log likelihood. Our DoGS variant employs Algorithm 2 with d = 1,
early stopping parameter ✏ = 0.01, and a Dobrushin influence bound constructed from the latest parameter estimate
✓ˆ using Theorem 11. We set the number of gradient steps,
MC steps per gradient, and independent runs of Gibbs sampling to the suggested values in (Domke, 2015). After each
gradient update, we record the distance between the optimal
and estimated parameters. Figure 3 displays the estimation
error of five independent replicates of this experiment using
each of two scans (uniform or DoGS) for two models (a
3 ⇥ 3 and a 4 ⇥ 4 Ising model). The results show that DoGS
consistently achieves the desired parameter accuracy much
more quickly than standard Gibbs.

indicate whether a patch is in the marginal rectangle highlighted in Figure 6) and compare its segmentation accuracy
and efficiency with that of a standard systematic scan of
length T = 620. We initialize DoGS with the systematic
scan, the influence bound C̄ of Theorem 10, and a target
accuracy ✏ equal to the marginal Dobrushin variation guarantee of the systematic scan. In 11.5ms, the doubling scheme
described in Section 5.2 produced a DoGS sequence of
length 110 achieving the Dobrushin variation guarantee ✏ on
marginal TV. Figure 7 shows that DoGS achieves a slightly
better average Hamming error than systematic scan using a

6. Discussion
We introduced a practical quality measure – Dobrushin variation – for evaluating and comparing existing Gibbs sampler
scans and efficient procedures – DoGS – for developing
customized fast-mixing scans tailored to marginals or distributional features of interest. We deployed DoGS for three
common Gibbs sampler applications – joint image segmentation and object recognition, MCMC maximum likelihood
estimation, and Ising model inference – and in each case
achieved higher quality inferences with significantly smaller
sampling budgets than standard Gibbs samplers. In the future, we aim to enlist DoGS for additional applications in
computer vision and natural language processing, extend the
reach of DoGS to models containing continuous variables,
and integrate DoGS into large inference engines built atop
Gibbs sampling.
