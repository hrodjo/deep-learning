Abstract
Deep reinforcement learning methods attain
super-human performance in a wide range of environments. Such methods are grossly inefficient,
often taking orders of magnitudes more data than
humans to achieve reasonable performance. We
propose Neural Episodic Control: a deep reinforcement learning agent that is able to rapidly
assimilate new experiences and act upon them.
Our agent uses a semi-tabular representation of
the value function: a buffer of past experience containing slowly changing state representations and
rapidly updated estimates of the value function.
We show across a wide range of environments
that our agent learns significantly faster than other
state-of-the-art, general purpose deep reinforcement learning agents.

1. Introduction
Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-ofthe-art results in a variety of complex environments (Mnih
et al., 2015; 2016), often surpassing human performance (Silver et al., 2016). Although the final performance
of these agents is impressive, these techniques usually require several orders of magnitude more interactions with
their environment than a human in order to reach an equivalent level of expected performance. For example, in the
Atari 2600 set of environments (Bellemare et al., 2013),
deep Q-networks (Mnih et al., 2016) require more than 200
hours of gameplay in order to achieve scores similar to those
a human player achieves after two hours (Lake et al., 2016).
The glacial learning speed of deep reinforcement learning
has several plausible explanations and in this work we focus
on addressing these:
1. Stochastic gradient descent optimisation requires the use
of small learning rates. Due to the global approximation
nature of neural networks, high learning rates cause catastrophic interference (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989). Low

learning rates mean that experience can only be incorporated into a neural network slowly.
2. Environments with a sparse reward signal can be difficult
for a neural network to model as there may be very few
instances where the reward is non-zero. This can be viewed
as a form of class imbalance where low-reward samples
outnumber high-reward samples by an unknown number.
Consequently, the neural network disproportionately underperforms at predicting larger rewards, making it difficult for
an agent to take the most rewarding actions.
3. Reward signal propagation by value-bootstrapping techniques, such as Q-learning, results in reward information
being propagated one step at a time through the history of
previous interactions with the environment. This can be
fairly efficient if updates happen in reverse order in which
the transitions occur. However, in order to train on uncorrelated minibatches DQN-style, algorithms train on randomly
selected transitions, and, in order to further stabilise training,
require the use of a slowly updating target network further
slowing down reward propagation.
In this work we shall focus on addressing the three concerns listed above; we must note, however, that other recent
advances in exploration (Osband et al., 2016), hierarchical
reinforcement learning (Vezhnevets et al., 2016) and transfer learning (Rusu et al., 2016; Fernando et al., 2017) also
make substantial contributions to improving data efficiency
in deep reinforcement learning over baseline agents.
In this paper we propose Neural Episodic Control (NEC),
a method which tackles the limitations of deep reinforcement learning listed above and demonstrates dramatic improvements on the speed of learning for a wide range of
environments. Critically, our agent is able to rapidly latch
onto highly successful strategies as soon as they are experienced, instead of waiting for many steps of optimisation
(e.g., stochastic gradient descent) as is the case with DQN
(Mnih et al., 2015) and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016).
Our work is in part inspired by the hypothesised role of the
Hippocampus in decision making (Lengyel & Dayan, 2007;
Blundell et al., 2016) and also by recent work on one-shot
learning (Vinyals et al., 2016) and learning to remember
rare events with neural networks (Kaiser et al., 2016). Our
agent uses a semi-tabular representation of its experience
of the environment possessing several of the features of
episodic memory such as long term memory, sequentiality,

Neural Episodic Control

and context-based lookups. The semi-tabular representation
is an append-only memory that binds slow-changing keys
to fast updating values and uses a context-based lookup on
the keys to retrieve useful values during action selection
by the agent. Thus the agent’s memory operates in much
the same way that traditional table-based RL methods map
from state and action to value estimates. A unique aspect
of the memory in contrast to other neural memory architectures for reinforcement learning (explained in more detail in
Section 3) is that the values retrieved from the memory can
be updated much faster than the rest of the deep neural network. This helps alleviate the typically slow weight updates
of stochastic gradient descent applied to the whole network
and is reminiscent of work on fast weights (Ba et al., 2016;
Hinton & Plaut, 1987), although the architecture we present
is quite different. Another unique aspect of the memory
is that unlike other memory architectures such as LSTM
and the differentiable neural computer (DNC; Graves et al.,
2016), our architecture does not try to learn when to write to
memory, as this can be slow to learn and take a significant
amount of time. Instead, we elect to write all experiences to
the memory, and allow it to grow very large compared to existing memory architectures (in contrast to Oh et al. (2015);
Graves et al. (2016) where the memory is wiped at the end
of each episode). Reading from this large memory is made
efficient using kd-tree based nearest neighbour algorithm
(Bentley, 1975).
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we review deep reinforcement learning, in Section 3
the Neural Episodic Control algorithm is described, in Section 4 we report experimental results in the Atari Learning
Environment, in Section 5 we discuss other methods that use
memory for reinforcement learning, and finally in Section 6
we outline future work and summarise the main advantages
of the NEC algorithm.

2. Deep Reinforcement Learning
The action-value function of a reinforcement learning
π
agent
P(Sutton & Barto, 1998) is defined as Q (s, a) =
Eπ [ t γ t rt | s, a], where a is the initial action taken by
the agent in the initial state s and the expectation denotes
that the policy π is followed thereafter. The discount factor γ ∈ (0, 1) trades off favouring short vs. long term
rewards.
Deep Q-Network agents (DQN; Mnih et al., 2015) use Qlearning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992) to learn a value function
Q(st , at ) to rank which action at is best to take in each
state st at step t. The agent then executes an -greedy policy
based upon this value function to trade-off exploration and
exploitation: with probability  the agent picks an action
uniformly at random, otherwise it picks the action at =
arg maxa Q(st , a).
In DQN, the action-value function Q(st , at ) is parameterised by a convolutional neural network that takes a 2D

pixel representation of the state st as input, and outputs
a vector containing the value of each action at that state.
When the agent observes a transition, DQN stores the
(st , at , rt , st+1 ) tuple in a replay buffer, the contents of
which are used for training. This neural network is trained
by minimizing the squared error between the network’s output and the Q-learning target yt = rt + γ maxa Q̃(st+1 , a),
for a subset of transitions sampled at random from the replay
buffer. The target network Q̃(st+1 , a) is an older version of
the value network that is updated periodically. The use of
a target network and uncorrelated samples from the replay
buffer are critical for stable training.
A number of extensions have been proposed that improve
DQN. Double DQN (Van Hasselt et al., 2016) reduces bias
on the target calculation. Prioritised Replay (Schaul et al.,
2015b) further improves Double DQN by optimising the
replay strategy. Several authors have proposed methods of
improving reward propagation and the back up mechanism
of Q learning (Harutyunyan et al., 2016; Munos et al., 2016;
He et al., 2016) by incorporating on-policy rewards or by
adding constraints to the optimisation. Q∗ (λ) (Harutyunyan
et al., 2016) and Retrace(λ) (Munos et al., 2016) change
the form of the Q-learning target to incorporate on-policy
samples and fluidly switch between on-policy learning and
off-policy learning. Munos et al. (2016) show that by incorporating on-policy samples allows an agent to learn faster
in Atari environments, indicating that reward propagation
is indeed a bottleneck to efficiency in deep reinforcement
learning.
A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) is another well known deep reinforcement learning algorithm that is very different from
DQN. It is based upon a policy gradient, and learns both a
policy and its associated value function, which is learned
entirely on-policy (similar to the λ = 1 case of Q(λ)). Interestingly, Mnih et al. (2016) also added an LSTM memory
to the otherwise convolutional neural network architecture
to give the agent a notion of memory, although this did not
have significant impact on the performance on Atari games.

3. Neural Episodic Control
Our agent consists of three components: a convolutional neural network that processes pixel images s, a set of memory
modules (one per action), and a final network that converts
read-outs from the action memories into Q(s, a) values. For
the convolutional neural network we use the same architecture as DQN (Mnih et al., 2015).
3.1. Differentiable Neural Dictionary
For each action a ∈ A, NEC has a simple memory module
Ma = (Ka , Va ), where Ka and Va are dynamically sized
arrays of vectors, each containing the same number of vectors. The memory module acts as an arbitrary association
from keys to corresponding values, much like the dictionary
data type found in programs. Thus we refer to this kind of

Neural Episodic Control

memory module as a differentiable neural dictionary (DND).
There are two operations possible on a DND: lookup and
write, as depicted in Figure 1. Performing a lookup on a
DND maps a key h to an output value o:
X
o=
wi vi ,
(1)
i

where vi is the ith element of the array Va and
X
wi = k(h, hi )/
k(h, hj ),

(2)

j

where hi is the ith element of the array Ka and k(x, y) is
a kernel between vectors x and y, e.g., Gaussian kernel.
Thus the output of a lookup in a DND is a weighted sum
of the values in the memory, whose weights are given by
normalised kernels between the lookup key and the corresponding key in memory. To make queries into very large
memories scalable we shall make two approximations in
practice: firstly, we shall limit (1) to the top p-nearest neighbours (typically p = 50). Secondly, we use an approximate
nearest neighbours algorithm to perform the lookups, based
upon kd-trees (Bentley, 1975).
After a DND is queried, a new key-value pair is written into
the memory. The key written corresponds to the key that
was looked up. The associated value is application-specific
(below we specify the update for the NEC agent). Writes to
a DND are append-only: keys and values are written to the
memory by appending them onto the end of the arrays Ka
and Va respectively. If a key already exists in the memory,
then its corresponding value is updated, rather than being
duplicated.
Note that a DND is a differentiable version of the memory
module described in Blundell et al. (2016). It is also a generalisation to the memory and lookup schemes described in
Vinyals et al. (2016); Kaiser et al. (2016) for classification.
3.2. Agent Architecture
Figure 2 shows a DND as part of the NEC agent for a single
action, whilst Algorithm 1 describes the general outline of
the NEC algorithm. The pixel state s is processed by a
convolutional neural network to produce a key h. The key
h is then used to lookup a value from the DND, yielding
weights wi in the process for each element of the memory
arrays. Finally, the output is a weighted sum of the values
in the DND. The values in the DND, in the case of an
NEC agent, are the Q values corresponding to the state that
originally resulted in the corresponding key-value pair to
be written to the memory. Thus this architecture produces
an estimate of Q(s, a) for a single given action a. The
architecture is replicated once for each action a the agent
can take, with the convolutional part of the network shared
among each separate DND Ma . The NEC agent acts by
taking the action with the highest Q-value estimate at each
time step. In practice, we use -greedy policy during training
with a low .

3.3. Adding (s, a) pairs to memory
As an NEC agent acts, it continually adds new key-value
pairs to its memory. Keys are appended to the memory of
the corresponding action, taking the value of the query key
h encoded by the convolutional neural network. We now
turn to the question of an appropriate corresponding value.
In Blundell et al. (2016), Monte Carlo returns were written
to memory. We found that a mixture of Monte Carlo returns
(on-policy) and off-policy backups worked better and so for
NEC we elect to use N -step Q-learning as in Mnih et al.
(2016) (see also Watkins, 1989; Peng & Williams, 1996).
This adds the following N on-policy rewards and bootstraps
the sum of discounted rewards for the rest of the trajectory,
off-policy. The N -step Q-value estimate is then
Q(N ) (st , a) =

N
−1
X
j=0

γ j rt+j + γ N max
Q(st+N , a0 ) . (3)
0
a

The bootstrap term of (3), maxa0 Q(st+N , a0 ) is found by
querying all memories Ma for each action a and taking the
highest estimated Q-value returned. Note that the earliest
such values can be added to memory is N steps after a
particular (s, a) pair occurs.
When a state-action value is already present in a DND (i.e
the key h corresponding to the visited state is already in
Ka ), the corresponding value present in Va , Qi , is updated
in the same way as the classic tabular Q-learning algorithm:
Qi ← Qi + α(Q(N ) (s, a) − Qi ) .

(4)

where α is the learning rate of the Q update. If the state is
not already present Q(N ) (st , a) is appended to Va and h is
appended to Ka . Note that our agent learns the value function in much the same way that a classic tabular Q-learning
agent does, except that the Q-table grows with time. We
found that α could take on a high value, allowing repeatedly
visited states with a stable representation to rapidly update

their value function estimate. Additionally, batching up
memory updates (e.g., after each episode) helps with computational performance. We overwrite the item that has least
recently been a neighbour when we reach the memory’s
maximum capacity.
3.4. Learning
Agent parameters are updated by minimising the L2 loss
between the predicted Q value for a given action and the
Q(N ) estimate on randomly sampled mini-batches from a
replay buffer. In particular, we store tuples (st , at , Rt ) in
the replay buffer, where N is the horizon of the N -step Q
rule, and Rt = Q(N ) (st , a) plays the role of the target network seen in DQN (our replay buffer is significantly smaller
than DQN’s). These (st , at , Rt )-tuples are then sampled
uniformly at random to form minibatches for training. Note
that the architecture in Figure 2 is entirely differentiable and
so we can minimize this loss by gradient descent. Backpropagation updates the weights and biases of the convolutional
embedding network and the keys and values of each actionspecific memory using gradients of this loss, using a lower
learning rate than is used for updating pairs after queries.

4. Experiments
We investigated whether neural episodic control allows for
more data efficient learning in practice in complex domains.
As a problem domain we chose the Atari Learning Environment(ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013). We tested our method
on the 57 Atari games used by Schaul et al. (2015a), which
form an interesting set of tasks as they contain diverse challenges such as sparse rewards and vastly different magnitudes of scores across games. Most common algorithms
applied in these domains, such as variants of DQN and A3C,
require in the thousands of hours of in-game time, i.e. they
are data inefficient.
We consider 5 variants of A3C and DQN as baselines
as well as MFEC (Blundell et al., 2016). We compare
to the basic implementations of A3C (Mnih et al., 2016)
and DQN (Mnih et al., 2015). We also compare to two

algorithms incorporating λ returns (Sutton, 1988) aiming
at more data efficiency by faster propagation of credit assignments, namely Q∗ (λ) (Harutyunyan et al., 2016) and
Retrace(λ) (Munos et al., 2016). We also compare to DQN
with Prioritised Replay, which improves data efficiency by
replaying more salient transitions more frequently. We did
not directly compare to DRQN (Hausknecht & Stone, 2015)
nor FRMQN (Oh et al., 2016) as results were not available
for all Atari games. Note that in the case of DRQN, reported
performance is lower than that of Prioritised Replay.
All algorithms were trained using discount rate γ = 0.99,
except MFEC that uses γ = 1. In our implementation
of MFEC we used random projections as an embedding
function, since in the original publication it obtained better
performance on the Atari games tested.
In terms of hyperparameters for NEC, we chose the same
convolutional architecture as DQN, and store up to 5 ×
105 memories per action. We used the RMSProp algorithm (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) for gradient descent training. We apply the same preprocessing steps as (Mnih et al.,
2015), including repeating each action four times. For the
N -step Q estimates we picked a horizon of N = 100. Our
replay buffer stores the only last 105 states (as opposed to
106 for DQN) observed and their N -step Q estimates. We
do one replay update for every 16 observed frames with a
minibatch of size 32. We set the number of nearest neighbours p = 50 in all our experiments. For the kernel function
we chose a function that interpolates between the mean
for short distances and weighted inverse distance for large
distances, more precisely:
k(h, hi ) =

1
.
kh − hi k22 + δ

(5)

Intuitively, when all neighbours are far away we want to
avoid putting all weight onto one data point. A Gaussian
kernel, for example, would exponentially suppress all neighbours except for the closest one. The kernel we chose has
the advantage of having heavy tails. This makes the algorithm more robust and we found it to be less sensitive to

neural network on the bottom left and an estimate of Q(s, a) exits top right. Gradients flow through the entire architecture.

kernel hyperparameters. We set δ = 10−3 . In order to
determine whether an key corresponding to a given state is
already present in the table we store a hash of the observation for each state and check whether the hash is present
when inserting.
In order to tune the remaining hyperparameters (SGD
learning-rate, fast-update learning-rate α in Equation 4, dimensionality of the embeddings, Q(N ) in Equation 3, and greedy exploration-rate) we ran a hyperparameter sweep on
six games: Beam Rider, Breakout, Pong, Q*Bert, Seaquest
and Space Invaders. We picked the hyperparameter values
that performed best on the median for this subset of games (a
common cross validation procedure described by Bellemare
et al. (2013), and adhered to by Mnih et al. (2015)).
Data efficiency results are summarised in Table 1. In the
small data regime (less than 20 million frames) NEC clearly
outperforms all other algorithms. The difference is especially pronounced before 5 million frames have been observed. Only at 40 million frames does DQN with Prioritised Replay outperform NEC on average; note that this
corresponds to 185 hours of gameplay.
In order to provide a more detailed picture of NEC’s performance, Figures 3 to 7 show learning curves on 6 games
(Alien, Bowling, Boxing, Frostbite, HERO, Ms. Pac-Man,
Pong), where several stereotypical cases of NEC’s performance can be observed 1 . All learning curves show the
average performance over 5 different initial random seeds.
We evaluate MFEC and NEC every 200.000 frames, and the
other algorithms are evaluated every million steps.
Across most games, NEC is significantly faster at learning
in the initial phase (see also Table 1), only comparable to
MFEC, which also uses an episodic-like Q-function.
NEC also outperforms MFEC on average (see Table 2).
In contrast with MFEC, NEC uses the reward signal to
learn an embedding adequate for value interpolation. This
difference is especially significant in games where a few
pixels determine the value of each action. The simpler
version of MFEC uses an approximation to L2 distances

in pixel-space by means of random projections, and cannot
focus on the small but most relevant details. Another version
of MFEC calculated distances on the latent representation of
a variational autoencoder (Kingma & Welling, 2013) trained
to model frames. This latent representation does not depend
on rewards and will be subject to irrelevant details like, for
example, the display of the current score.
A3C, DQN and related algorithms require rewards to be
clipped to the range [−1, 1] for training stability2 (Mnih
et al., 2015). NEC and MFEC do not require reward clipping, which results in qualitative changes in behaviour and
better performance relative to other algorithms on games
requiring clipping (Bowling, Frostbite, H.E.R.O., Ms. PacMan, and Alien out of the seven shown).

Figure 3. Learning curve on Bowling.

Alien and Ms. Pac-Man both involve controlling a character, where there is an easy way to collect small rewards
by collecting items of which there are plenty, while avoiding enemies, which are invulnerable to the agent. On the
other hand the agent can pick up a special item making enemies vulnerable, allowing the agent to attack them and get
significantly larger rewards than from collecting the small
rewards. Agents trained using existing parametric methods
tend to show little interest in this as clipping implies there

is no difference between large and small rewards. Therefore, as NEC does not need reward clipping, it can strongly
outperform other algorithms, since NEC is maximising the
non-clipped score (the true score). This can also be seen
when observing the agents play: parametric methods will
tend to collect small rewards, while NEC will try to actively
make the enemies vulnerable and attack them to get large
rewards.
NEC also outperforms the other algorithms on Pong and
Boxing where reward clipping does not affect any of the
algorithms as all original rewards are in the range [−1, 1];
as can be expected, NEC does not outperform others in
terms of maximally achieved score, but it is vastly more
data efficient.
In Figure 10 we show a chart of human-normalised scores
across all 57 Atari games at 10 million frames comparing to
Prioritised Replay and MFEC. The human normalised score
is computed as (sAgent − sRandom )/(sHuman − sRandom ),
where sRandom denotes the score achieved by an agent
picking actions uniformly at random. We rank the games

independently for each algorithm, and on the y-axis the
deciles are shown.
We can see that NEC gets to a human level performance in
about 25% of the games within 10 million frames. As we
can see NEC outperforms MFEC and Prioritised Replay.

5. Related work
There has been much recent work on memory architectures for neural networks (LSTM; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), DNC (Graves et al., 2016), memory networks
(Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2016)). Recurrent neural network representations of memory (LSTMs and DNCs)
are trained by truncated backpropagation through time, and
are subject to the same slow learning of non-recurrent neural
networks.
Some of these models have been adapted to their use in RL
agents (LSTMs; Bakker et al., 2003; Hausknecht & Stone,
2015), DNCs (Graves et al., 2016), memory networks (Oh
et al., 2016). However, the contents of these memories is

typically reset at the beginning of every episode. This is appropriate when the goal of the memory is tracking previous
observations in order to maximise rewards in partially observable or non-Markovian environments. Therefore, these
implementations can be thought of as a type of working
memory, and solve a different problem than the one addressed in this work.
RNNs can learn to quickly write highly rewarding states into
memory and may even be able to learn entire reinforcement
learning algorithms (Wang et al., 2016; Duan et al., 2016).
However, doing so can take an arbitrarily long time and the
learning time likely scales strongly with the complexity of
the task.
The work of Oh et al. (2016) is also reminiscent of the ideas
presented here. They introduced (FR)MQN, an adaptation
of memory networks used in the top layers of a Q-network.
Kaiser et al. (2016) introduced a differentiable layer of keyvalue pairs that can be plugged into a neural network. This
layer uses cosine similarity to calculate a weighted average
of the values associated with the k most similar memories.
Their use of a moving average update rule is reminiscent of
the one presented in Section 3. The authors reported results
on a set of supervised tasks, however they did not consider
applications to reinforcement learning. Other deep RL methods keep a history of previous experience. Indeed, DQN
itself has an elementary form of memory: the replay buffer

central to its stable training can be viewed as a memory
that is frequently replayed to distil the contents into DQN’s
value network. Kumaran et al. (2016) suggest that training
on replayed experiences from the replay buffer in DQN is
similar to the replay of experiences from episodic memory during sleep in animals. DQN’s replay buffer differs
from most other work on memory for deep reinforcement
learning in its sheer scale: it is common for DQN’s replay
buffer to hold millions of (s, a, r, s0 ) tuples. The use of local regression techniques for Q-function approximation has
been suggested before: Santamarı́a et al. (1997) proposed
the use of k-nearest-neighbours regression with a heuristic for adding memories based on the distance to previous
memories. Munos & Moore (1998) proposed barycentric
interpolators to model the value function and proved their
convergence to the optimal value function under mild conditions, but no empirical results were presented. Gabel &
Riedmiller (2005) also suggested the use of local regression,
under the paradigm of case-based-reasoning that included
heuristics for the deletion of stored cases. Blundell et al.
(2016, MFEC) recently used local regression for Q-function
estimation using the mean of the k-nearest neighbours, except in the case of an exact match of the query point, in
which case the stored value was returned. They also propose the use of the latent variable obtained from a variational
autoencoder (Rezende et al., 2014) as an embedding space,

but showed random projections often obtained better results.
In contrast with the ideas presented here, none of the localregression work aforementioned uses the reward signal to
learn an embedding space of covariates in which to perform
the local-regression. We learn this embedding space using
temporal-difference learning; a crucial difference, as we
showed in the experimental comparison to MFEC.

6. Discussion
We have proposed Neural Episodic Control (NEC): a deep
reinforcement learning agent that learns significantly faster
than other baseline agents on a wide range of Atari 2600
games. At the core of NEC is a memory structure: a Differentiable Neural Dictionary (DND), one for each potential
action. NEC inserts recent state representations paired with
corresponding value functions into the appropriate DND.
Our experiments show that NEC requires an order of mag-

nitude fewer interactions with the environment than agents
previously proposed for data efficiency, such as Prioritised
Replay (Schaul et al., 2015b) and Retrace(λ) (Munos et al.,
2016). We speculate that NEC learns faster through a combination of three features of the agent: the memory architecture (DND), the use of N -step Q estimates, and a state
representation provided by a convolutional neural network.
The memory architecture, DND, rapidly integrates recent
experience—state representations and corresponding value
estimates—allowing this information to be quickly modify future behaviour. Such memories persist across many
episodes, and we use a fast approximate nearest neighbour
algorithm (kd-trees) to ensure that they can be efficiently
accessed. Estimating Q-values by using the N -step Q value
function interpolates between Monte Carlo value estimates
and backed up off-policy estimates. Monte Carlo value estimates reflect the rewards an agent is actually receiving,
whilst backed up off-policy estimates should be more representative of the value function at the optimal policy, but
evolve much slower. By using both estimates, NEC can
trade-off between these two estimation procedures and their
relative strengths and weaknesses (speed of reward propagation vs optimality). Finally, by having a slow changing,
stable representation provided by a convolutional neural
network, keys stored in the DND remain relative stable.
Our work suggests that non-parametric methods are a
promising addition to the deep reinforcement learning toolbox, especially where data efficiency is paramount. In our
experiments we saw that at the beginning of learning NEC
outperforms other agents in terms of learning speed. We
saw that later in learning Prioritised Replay has higher performance than NEC. We leave it to future work to further
improve NEC so that its long term final performance is significantly superior to parametric agents. Another avenue of
further research would be to apply the method discussed in
this paper to a wider range of tasks such as visually more
complex 3D worlds or real world tasks where data efficiency
is of great importance.
