Abstract
Optimization of high-dimensional black-box
functions is an extremely challenging problem.
While Bayesian optimization has emerged as
a popular approach for optimizing black-box
functions, its applicability has been limited to
low-dimensional problems due to its computational and statistical challenges arising from
high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose to tackle these challenges by (1) assuming
a latent additive structure in the function and inferring it properly for more efficient and effective BO, and (2) performing multiple evaluations
in parallel to reduce the number of iterations required by the method. Our novel approach learns
the latent structure with Gibbs sampling and constructs batched queries using determinantal point
processes. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world functions demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

1. Introduction
Optimization is one of the fundamental pillars of modern
machine learning. Considering that most modern machine
learning methods involve the solution of some optimization
problem, it is not surprising that many recent breakthroughs
in this area have been on the back of more effective techniques for optimization. A case in point is deep learning,
whose rise has been mirrored by the development of numerous techniques like batch normalization.
While modern algorithms have been shown to be very

effective for convex optimization problems defined over
continuous domains, the same cannot be stated for nonconvex optimization, which has generally been dominated
by stochastic techniques. During the last decade, Bayesian
optimization has emerged as a popular approach for optimizing black-box functions. However, its applicability is
limited to low-dimensional problems because of computational and statistical challenges that arise from optimization
in high-dimensional settings.
In the past, these two problems have been addressed by
assuming a simpler underlying structure of the black-box
function. For instance, Djolonga et al. (2013) assume that
the function being optimized has a low-dimensional effective subspace, and learn this subspace via low-rank matrix
recovery. Similarly, Kandasamy et al. (2015) assume additive structure of the function where different constituent
functions operate on disjoint low-dimensional subspaces.
The subspace decomposition can be partially optimized by
searching possible decompositions and choosing the one
with the highest GP marginal likelihood (treating the decomposition as a hyper-parameter of the GP). Fully optimizing the decomposition is, however, intractable. Li et al.
(2016) extended (Kandasamy et al., 2015) to functions with
a projected-additive structure, and approximate the projective matrix via projection pursuit with the assumption that
the projected subspaces have the same and known dimensions. The aforementioned approaches share the computational challenge of learning the groups of decomposed subspaces without assuming the dimensions of the subspaces
are known. Both (Kandasamy et al., 2015) and subsequently (Li et al., 2016) adapt the decomposition by maximizing the GP marginal likelihood every certain number of
iterations. However, such maximization is computationally
intractable due to the combinatorial nature of the partitions
of the feature space, which forces prior work to adopt randomized search heuristics.
In this paper, we develop a new formulation of Bayesian
optimization specialized for high dimensions. One of the
key contributions of this work is a new formulation that
interprets prior work on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) through the lens of structured kernels,
and places a prior on the kernel structure. Thereby, our

Batched High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Structural Kernel Learning

formulation enables simultaneous learning of the decomposition of the function domain.
Prior work on latent decomposition of the feature space
considers the setting where exploration/evaluation is performed once at a time. This approach makes Bayesian
optimization time-consuming for problems where a large
number of function evaluations need to be made, which is
the case for high dimensional problems. To overcome this
restriction, we extend our approach to a batched version
that allows multiple function evaluations to be performed
in parallel (Desautels et al., 2014; González et al., 2016;
Kathuria et al., 2016). Our second contribution is an approach to select the batch of evaluations for structured kernel learning-based HDBO.
Other Related Work. In the past half century, a series
of different acquisition functions was developed for sequential BO in relatively low dimensions (Kushner, 1964;
Moc̆kus, 1974; Srinivas et al., 2012; Hennig & Schuler,
2012; Hernández-Lobato et al., 2014; Kawaguchi et al.,
2015; Wang et al., 2016a; Kawaguchi et al., 2016; Wang
& Jegelka, 2017). More recent developments address
high dimensional BO by making assumptions on the latent structure of the function to be optimized, such as lowdimensional structure (Wang et al., 2016b; Djolonga et al.,
2013) or additive structure of the function (Li et al., 2016;
Kandasamy et al., 2015). Duvenaud et al. (2013) explicitly
search over kernel structures.
While the aforementioned methods are sequential in nature, the growth of computing power has motivated settings
where at once a batch of points is selected for observation (Contal et al., 2013; Desautels et al., 2014; González
et al., 2016; Snoek et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017). For
example, the UCB-PE algorithm (Contal et al., 2013) exploits that the posterior variance of a Gaussian Process
is independent of the function mean. It greedily selects
points with the highest posterior variance, and is able to update the variances without observations in between selections. Similarly, B-UCB (Desautels et al., 2014) greedily
chooses points with the highest UCB score computed via
the out-dated function mean but up-to-date function variances. However, these methods may be too greedy in their
selection, resulting in points that lie far from an optimum.
More recently, Kathuria et al. (2016) tries to resolve this issue by sampling the batch via a diversity-promoting distribution for better randomized exploration, while Wang et al.
(2017) quantifies the goodness of the batch with a submodular surrogate function that trades off quality and diversity.

2. Background
Let f : X → R be an unknown function and we aim to
optimize it over a compact set X ⊆ RD . Within as few

function evaluations as possible, we want to find
f (x∗ ) = max f (x).
x∈X

Following (Kandasamy et al., 2015), we assume a latent decomposition of the feature dimensions [D] = {1, . . . , D}
SM
into disjoint subspaces, namely, m=1 Am = [D] and
Ai ∩ Aj = ∅ for all i 6= j, i, j ∈ [D]. Further, f can
be decomposed into the following additive form:
X
f (x) =
fm (xAm ).
m∈[M ]

To make the problem tractable, we assume that each fm is
drawn independently from GP(0, k (m) ) for all m ∈ [M ].
The resulting f will also be a samplePfrom a GP: f ∼
GP(µ, k), where the priors are µ(x) = m∈[M ] µm (xAm )

and k(x, x0 ) =

N (f (xt ), σ). The log data likelihood for Dn is
log p(Dn |{k (m) , Am }m∈[M ] )

We use regret to evaluate the BO algorithms, both in the
sequential and the batch selection case. For the sequential
selection, let r̃t = maxx∈X f (x) − f (xt ) denote the immediate regret at iteration t. We are interested
in both the
P
averaged cumulative regret RT = T1 t r̃t and the simple
regret rT = mint≤T r̃t for a total number of T iterations.
For batch evaluations, r̃t = maxx∈X ,b∈[B] f (x) − f (xt,b )
denotes the immediate regret obtained by the batch at iteration t. The P
averaged cumulative regret of the batch setting
is RT = T1 t r̃t , and the simple regret rT = mint≤T r̃t .
We use the averaged cumulative regret in the bandit setting,
where each evaluation of the function incurs a cost. If we
simply want to optimize the function, we use the simple
regret to capture the minimum gap between the best point
found and the global optimum of the black-box function f .
Note that the averaged cumulative regret upper bounds the
simple regret.

3. Learning Additive Kernel Structure
We take a Bayesian view on the task of learning the latent
structure of the GP kernel. The decomposition of the input
space X will be learned simultaneously with optimization
as more and more data is observed. Our generative model
draws mixing proportions θ ∼ D IR(α). Each dimension
j is assigned to one out of M groups via the decomposition assignment variable zj ∼ M ULTI(θ). The objective

function is then f (x) =
m=1 fm (x
{j : zj = m} is the set of support dimensions for function
fm , and each fm is drawn from a Gaussian Process. Finally, given an input x, we observe y ∼ N (f (x), σ). Figure 1 illustrates the corresponding graphical model.
{(xt , yt )}nt=1 ,

Given the observed data Dn =
we obtain a
posterior distribution over possible decompositions z (and
mixing proportions θ) that we will include later in the BO
process:
p(z, θ | Dn ; α) ∝ p(Dn | z)p(z | θ)p(θ; α).
Marginalizing over θ yields the posterior distribution of the
decomposition assignment

p(z | Dn ; α) ∝ p(Dn | z) p(z | θ)p(θ; α) dθ

Γ( m αm ) Y Γ(|Am | + αm )
P
∝ p(Dn | z)
Γ(D + m αm ) m
Γ(αm )
where p(Dn |z) is the data likelihood (2.1) for the additive
GP given a fixed structure defined by z. We learn the posterior distribution for z via Gibbs sampling, choose the decomposition among the samples that achieves the highest
data likelihood, and then proceed with BO. The Gibbs sampler repeatedly draws coordinate assignments zj according
to
p(zj = m | z¬j , Dn ; α) ∝ p(Dn | z)p(zj | z¬j )
∝ p(Dn | z)(|Am | + αm ) ∝ eφm ,

and Kn j
is the gram matrix associated with the observations Dn by setting zj = m. We can use the Gumbel
trick to efficiently sample from this categorical distribution.
Namely, we sample a vector of i.i.d standard Gumbel variables ωi of length M , and then choose the sampled decomposition assignment zj = arg maxi≤M φi + ωi .
With a Dirichlet process, we could make the model nonparametric and the number M of possible groups in the
decomposition infinite. Given that we have a fixed number
of input dimension D, we set M = D in practice.

4. Diverse Batch Sampling
In real-world applications where function evaluations
translate into time-intensive experiments, the typical sequential exploration strategy – observe one function value,
update the model, then select the next observation – is undesirable. Batched Bayesian Optimization (BBO) (Azimi
et al., 2010; Contal et al., 2013; Kathuria et al., 2016) instead selects a batch of B observations to be made in parallel, then the model is updated with all simultaneously.
Extending this scenario to high dimensions, two questions
arise: (1) the acquisition function is expensive to optimize and (2), by itself, does not sufficiently account for
exploration. The additive kernel structure improves efficiency for (1). For batch selection (2), we need an efficient
strategy that enourages observations that are both informative and non-redundant. Recent work (Contal et al., 2013;
Kathuria et al., 2016) selects a point that maximizes the acquisition function, and adds additional batch points via a
diversity criterion. In high dimensions, this diverse selection becomes expensive. For example, if each dimension
has a finite number of possible values1 , the cost of sampling
batch points via a Determinantal Point Process (DPP), as
proposed in (Kathuria et al., 2016), grows exponentially
with the number of dimensions. The same obstacle arises
with the approach by Contal et al. (2013), where points
are selected greedily. Thus, naı̈ve adoptions of these approaches in our setting would result in intractable algorithms. Instead, we propose a general approach that explicitly takes advantage of the structured kernel to enable
relevant, non-redundant high-dimensional batch selection.
We describe our approach for a single decomposition sampled from the posterior; it extends to a distribution of decompositions by sampling a set of decompositions from the
posterior and then sampling points for each decomposition
individually. Given a decomposition z, we define a separate Determinantal Point Process (DPP) on each group of
Am dimensions. A set S of points in the subspace R|Am |
(m)
is sampled with probability proportional to det(Kn (S)),
1

While we use this discrete categorical domain to illustrate the
batch setting, our proposed method is general and is applicable to
continuous box-constrained domains.

Batched High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Structural Kernel Learning
(m)

where Kn is the posterior covariance matrix of the mth group given n observations, and K(S) is the submatrix
of K with rows and columns indexed by S. Assuming the
group sizes are upper-bounded by some constant, sampling
from each such DPP individually implies an exponential
speedup compared to using the full kernel.
Sampling vs. Greedy Maximization The determinant
(m)
det(Kn (S)) measures diversity, and hence the DPP assigns higher probability to diverse subsets S. An alternative
to sampling is to directly maximize the determinant. While
this is NP-hard, a greedy strategy gives an approximate solution, and is used in (Kathuria et al., 2016), and in (Contal
et al., 2013) as Pure Exploration (PE). We too test this strategy in the experiments. In the beginning, if the GP is not
approximating the function well, then greedy may perform
no better than a stochastic combination of coordinates, as
we observe in Fig. 6.
Sample Combination Now we have chosen a diverse
(m)
subset Xm = {xi }i∈[B−1] ⊂ R|Am | of size (B − 1)
for each group Am . We need to combine these subspace
points to obtain B − 1 final batch query points in RD .
A simple way to combine samples from each group is to
do it randomly without replacement, i.e., we sample one
(m)
xi from each Xm uniformly randomly without replacement, and combine the parts, one for each m ∈ [M ], to get
one sample in RD . We repeat this procedure until we have
(B − 1) points. This retains diversity across the batch of
samples, since the samples are diverse within each group
of features.
Besides this random combination, we can also combine
(m)
samples greedily. We define a quality function ψt
for each group m ∈ [M ] at time t, and combine samples to maximize this quality function. Concretely, for
(m)
the first point, we combine the maximizers x∗
=
(m) (m)
arg maxx(m) ∈Xm ψt (x ) from each group. We re(m)
move those used parts, Xm ← Xm \{x∗ }, and repeat the
procedure until we have (B − 1) samples. In each iteration, the sample achieving the highest quality score gets
selected, while diversity is retained.
Both selection strategies can be combined with a wide
range of existing quality and acquisition functions.
Add-UCB-DPP-BBO We illustrate the above framework with GP-UCB (Srinivas et al., 2012) as both the acquisition and quality functions. The Upper Confidence

5. Empirical Results
We empirically evaluate our approach in two parts: First,
we verify the effectiveness of using our Gibbs sampling algorithm to learn the additive structure of the unknown function, and then we test our batch BO for
high dimensional problems with the Gibbs sampler. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zi-w/
Structural-Kernel-Learning-for-HDBBO.
5.1. Effectiveness of Decomposition Learning
We first probe the effectiveness of using the Gibbs sampling method described in Section 3 to learn the decomposition of the input space. More details of the experiments
including sensitivity analysis for α can be found in the appendix.
Recovering Decompositions First, we sample test functions from a known additive Gaussian Process prior with
zero-mean and isotropic Gaussian kernel with bandwidth
= 0.1 and scale = 5 for each function component. For
D = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 input dimensions, we randomly
sample decomposition settings that have at least two groups
in the decomposition and at most 3 dimensions in each
group.

Comparing PL-1 and PL-2 we can see that sampling more settings of decompositions did help to find a better decomposition. But a
more principled way of learning the decomposition using Gibbs can achieve much better performance than PL-1 and PL-2.

1. Empirically, Gibbs changes the decompositions
across iterations, especially in the beginning. With
fluctuating partitions, even exploitation leads to moving around, because the supposedly “good” points are
influenced by the partition. The result is an implicit
“exploration” effect that is absent with a fixed partition.
2. Gibbs sometimes merges “true” parts into larger
parts. The parameter βt in UCB depends on the size
of the part, |Am |(log 2t)/5 (as in (Kandasamy et al.,
2015)). Larger parts hence lead to larger βt and hence
more exploration.
Of course, more exploration is not always better, but
Gibbs was able to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation, which leads to better performance.
Our preliminary experiments indicate that one solution to
ensure that the ground truth decomposition produces the
best result is to tune βt . Hyperparameter selection (such as
choosing βt ) for BO is, however, very challenging and an
active topic of research (e.g. (Wang et al., 2016a)).

alternatives including partial learning. Since the function
we tested here is composed of the distance to two objects,
there could be some underlying additive structure for this
function in certain regions of the input space, e.g. when
the two robots hands are relatively distant from each other
so that one of the hands only impacts one of the objects.
Hence, it is possible for Gibbs to learn a good underlying
additive structure and perform effective BO with the structures it learned.

Overall, the results show that Gibbs outperforms both of

Gibbs is sometimes even better than Known. Interestingly, similar results can be found in Fig. 3 (c) of (Kandasamy et al., 2015), where different decompositions than
the ground truth may give better simple regret. We conjecture that this is because Gibbs is able to explore more than

highest data likelihood (PL-2). For the latter two learning
methods are referred to as “partial learning” in (Kandasamy
et al., 2015). The learning of the decomposition is done every 50 iterations. Fig. 3 shows the improvement of learning
decompositions with Gibbs over optimizing without partitions (NP).

Next, we test the decomposition learning algorithm on a
real-world function, which returns the distance between a
designated goal location and two objects being pushed by
two robot hands, whose trajectory is determined by 14 parameters specifying the location, rotation, velocity, moving direction etc. This function is implemented with a
physics engine, the Box2D simulator (Catto, 2011). We
use add-GP-UCB with different ways of setting the additive structure to tune the parameters for the robot hand so
as to push the object closer to the goal. The regrets are
shown in Fig. 4. We observe that the performance of learning the decomposition with Gibbs dominates all existing

pushing task. Learning decompositions with Gibbs is more effective than partial learning (PL-1, PL-2), no partitions (NP),
or fully partitioned (FP). Learning decompositions with Gibbs
helps BO to find a better point for this tuning task.

Figure 5. Scaled simple regrets (rt ) and scaled averaged cumulative regrets (Rt ) on synthetic functions with various dimensions when
the ground truth decomposition is known. The batch sampling methods (Batch-UCB-PE, Batch-UCB-DPP, Batch-UCB-PE-Fnc
and Batch-UCB-DPP-Fnc) perform comparably well and outperform random sampling (Rand) by a large gap.

5.2. Diverse Batch Sampling
Next, we probe the effectiveness of batch BO in high dimensions. In particular, we compare variants of the AddUCB-DPP-BBO approach outlined in Section 4, and a
baseline:
• Rand: All batch points are chosen uniformly at random from X .
• Batch-UCB-*: *∈ {PE, DPP}. All acquisition
functions are UCB (Eq. 4.1). Exploration is done via
PE or DPP with posterior covariance kernels for each
group. Combination is via sampling without replacement.
• *-Fnc: *∈ {Batch-UCB-PE, Batch-UCB-DPP}.
All quality functions are also UCB’s, and combination
is done by maximizing the quality functions.
A direct application of existing batch selection methods is
very inefficient in the high-dimensional settings where they
differ more, algorithmically, from our approach that ex-

ploits decompositions. Hence, we only compare to uniform
sampling as a baseline.
Effectiveness We tested on 2, 10, 20 and 50-dimensional
functions sampled the same way as in Section 5.1; we assume the ground-truth decomposition of the feature space
is known. Since Rand performs the worst, we show relative averaged cumulative regret and simple regret of all
methods compared to Rand in Fig. 5. Results for absolute
values of regrets are shown in the appendix. Each experiment was repeated for 20 times. For all experiments, we
set βtm = |Am | log 2t and B = 10. All diverse batch sampling methods perform comparably well and far better than
Rand, although there exist slight differences. While in
lower dimensions (D ∈ {2, 10}), Batch-UCB-PE-Fnc
performs among the best, in higher dimensions (D ∈
{20, 50}), Batch-UCB-DPP-Fnc performs better than
(or comparable to) all other variants. We will see a larger
performance gap in later real-world experiments, showing
that biasing the combination towards higher quality functions while retaining diversity across the batch of samples
provides a better exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Figure 7. Simple regret when tuning the 14 parameters of a robot
pushing task with batch size 5 and 10. Learning decompositions
with Gibbs sampling and diverse batch sampling are employed
simultaneously. In general, Batch-UCB-DPP-Fnc performs a
bit better than the other four diverse batch sampling variants. The
gap increases with batch size.

Moreover, their gain over existing methods increases as the
dimensionality of the input grows. We believe that these
results have the potential to enable the increased use of
Bayesian optimization for challenging black-box optimization problems in machine learning that typically involve a
large number of parameters.

For a real-data experiment, we tested the diverse batch sampling algorithms for BBO on the Walker function which
returns the walking speed of a three-link planar bipedal
walker implemented in Matlab (Westervelt et al., 2007).
We tune 25 parameters that may influence the walking
speed, including 3 sets of 8 parameters for the ODE solver
and 1 parameter specifying the initial velocity of the stance
leg. We discretize each dimension into 40 points, resulting
in a function domain of |X | = 4025 . This size is very inefficient for existing batch sampling techniques. We learn the
additive structure via Gibbs sampling and sample batches
of size B = 5. To further improve efficiency, we limit
the maximum size of each group to 2. The regrets for all
methods are shown in Fig. 6. Again, all diverse batch sampling methods outperform Rand by a large gap. Moreover,
Batch-UCB-DPP-Fnc is a bit better than other variants,
suggesting that a selection by quality functions is useful.

Figure 6. The simple regrets (rt ) of batch sampling methods on Walker data where B = 5. Four diverse batch
sampling methods (Batch-UCB-PE, Batch-UCB-DPP,
Batch-UCB-PE-Fnc
and
Batch-UCB-DPP-Fnc)
outperform random sampling (Rand) by a large gap.
Batch-UCB-DPP-Fnc performs the best among the four
diverse batch sampling methods.

Batch Sizes Finally, we show how the batch size B affects the performance of the proposed methods. We test
the algorithms on the 14-dimensional Robot dataset with
B ∈ {5, 10}. The regrets are shown in Fig. 4. With
larger batches, the differences between the batch selection
approaches become more pronounced. In both settings,
Batch-UCB-DPP-Fnc performs a bit better than other
variants, in particular with larger batch sizes.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose two novel solutions for high dimensional BO: inferring latent structure, and combining it
with batch Bayesian Optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective at optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions.
