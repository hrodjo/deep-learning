Pain-Free Random Differential Privacy with Sensitivity Sampling

Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein 1 Francesco Aldà 2

Abstract
Popular approaches to differential privacy, such
as the Laplace and exponential mechanisms, calibrate randomised smoothing through global sensitivity of the target non-private function. Bounding such sensitivity is often a prohibitively complex analytic calculation. As an alternative, we
propose a straightforward sampler for estimating sensitivity of non-private mechanisms. Since
our sensitivity estimates hold with high probability, any mechanism that would be (, δ)differentially private under bounded global sensitivity automatically achieves (, δ, γ)-random
differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012), without
any target-specific calculations required. We
demonstrate on worked example learners how
our usable approach adopts a naturally-relaxed
privacy guarantee, while achieving more accurate releases even for non-private functions that
are black-box computer programs.

1. Introduction
Differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006) has emerged as
the dominant framework for protected privacy of sensitive
training data when releasing learned models to untrusted
third parties. This paradigm owes its popularity in part
to the strong privacy model provided, and in part to the
availability of general building block mechanisms such as
the Laplace (Dwork et al., 2006) & exponential (McSherry
& Talwar, 2007), and to composition lemmas for building
up more complex mechanisms. These generic mechanisms
come endowed with privacy and utility bounds that hold
for any appropriate application. Such tools almost alleviate the burden of performing theoretical analysis in developing privacy-preserving learners. However a persis1

tent requirement is the need to bound global sensitivity—a
Lipschitz constant of the target, non-private function. For
simple scalar statistics of the private database, sensitivity
can be easily bounded (Dwork et al., 2006). However in
many applications—from collaborative filtering (McSherry
& Mironov, 2009) to Bayesian inference (Dimitrakakis
et al., 2014; 2017; Wang et al., 2015)—the principal challenge in privatisation is completing this calculation.
In this work we develop a simple approach to approximating global sensitivity with high probability, assuming
only oracle access to target function evaluations. Combined with generic mechanisms like Laplace, exponential,
Gaussian or Bernstein, our sampler enables systematising
of privatisation: arbitrary computer programs can be made
differentially private with no additional mathematical analysis nor dynamic/static analysis, whatsoever. Our approach
does not make any assumptions about the function under
evaluation or underlying sampling distribution.
Contributions. This paper contributes: i) S ENSITIVI TY S AMPLER for easily-implemented empirical estimation
of global sensitivity of (potentially black-box) non-private
mechanisms; ii) Empirical process theory for guaranteeing
random differential privacy for any mechanism that preserves (stronger) differential privacy under bounded global
sensitivity; iii) Experiments demonstrating our sampler on
learners for which analytical sensitivity bounds are highly
involved; and iv) Examples where sensitivity estimates beat
(pessimistic) bounds, delivering pain-free random differential privacy at higher levels of accuracy, when used in concert with generic privacy-preserving mechanisms.
Related Work. This paper builds on the large body of
work in differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006; Dwork
& Roth, 2014), which has gained broad interest in part
due the framework’s strong guarantees of data privacy
when releasing aggregate statistics or models, and due to
availability of many generic privatising mechanisms e.g.,:
Laplace (Dwork et al., 2006), exponential (McSherry &
Talwar, 2007), Gaussian (Dwork & Roth, 2014), Bernstein (Aldà & Rubinstein, 2017) and many more. While
these mechanisms present a path to privatisation without
need for reproving differential privacy or utility, they do
have in common a need to analytically bound sensitivity—
a Lipschitz-type condition on the target non-private func-

tion. Often derivations are intricate e.g., for collaborative filtering (McSherry & Mironov, 2009), SVMs (Rubinstein et al., 2012; Chaudhuri et al., 2011), model selection (Thakurta & Smith, 2013), feature selection (Kifer
et al., 2012), Bayesian inference (Dimitrakakis et al., 2014;
2017; Wang et al., 2015), SGD in deep learning (Abadi
et al., 2016), etc. Undoubtedly the non-trivial nature of
bounding sensitivity prohibits adoption by some domain
experts. We address this challenge through the S ENSITIVI TY S AMPLER that estimates sensitivity empirically—even
for privatising black-box computer programs—providing
high probability privacy guarantees generically.
Several systems have been developed to ease deployment
of differentially privacy, with Barthe et al. (2016) overviewing contributions from Programming Languages. Dynamic
approaches track privacy budget expended at runtime, e.g.,
the PINQ (McSherry, 2009; McSherry & Mahajan, 2010)
and Airavat (Roy et al., 2010) systems. Static checking approaches provide privacy usage forewarning, e.g.,:
Fuzz (Reed & Pierce, 2010; Palamidessi & Stronati, 2012),
DFuzz (Gaboardi et al., 2013). While promoting privacyby-design, such approaches impose specialised languages
or limit target feasibility—challenges addressed by this
work. Moreover our S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER mechanism
complements such systems, e.g., within broader frameworks for protecting against side-channel attacks (Haeberlen et al., 2011; Mohan et al., 2012).
Minami et al. (2016) show that special-case Gibbs sampler is (, δ)-DP without bounded sensitivity. Nissim et al.
(2007) ask: Why calibrate for worst-case global sensitivity when the actual database does not witness worst-case
neighbours? Their smoothed sensitivity approach privatises local sensitivity, which itself is sensitive to perturbation. While this can lead to better sensitivity estimates, our
sampled sensitivity still does not require analytical bounds.
A related approach is the sample-and-aggregate mechanism (Nissim et al., 2007) which avoids computation of
sensitivity of the underlying target function and instead requires sensitivity of an aggregator combining the outputs of
the non-private target run repeatedly on subsamples of the
data. By contrast, our approach provides direct sensitivity
estimates, permitting direct privatisation.
Our application of empirical process theory to estimate
hard-to-compute quantities resembles the work of Riondato
& Upfal (2015). They use VC-theory and sampling to approximate mining frequent itemsets. Here we approximate
analytical computations, and to our knowledge provide a
first generic mechanism that preserves random differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012)—a natural weakening of the
strong guarantee of differential privacy. Hall et al. (2012)
leverage empirical process theory for a specific worked example, while our setting is general sensitivity estimation.

2. Background
We are interested in non-private mechanism f : Dn →
B that maps databases in product space over domain D
to responses in a normed space B. The terminology
of “database” (DB) comes from statistical databases, and
should be understood as a dataset.
Example 1. For instance, in supervised learning of linear
classifiers, the domain could be Euclidean vectors comprising features & labels, and responses might be parameterisations of learned classifiers such as a normal vector.
We aim to estimate sensitivity which is commonly used to
calibrate noise in differentially-private mechanisms.
Definition 2. The global sensitivity of non-private f :
Dn → B is given by ∆ = supD,D0 kf (D) − f (D0 )kB ,
where the supremum is taken over all pairs of neighbouring databases D, D0 in Dn that differ in one point.
Definition 3. Randomized mechanism M : Dn → R
responding with values in arbitrary response set R preserves -differential privacy for  > 0 if for all neighbouring D, D0 ∈ Dn and measurable R ⊂ R it holds
that Pr (M (D) ∈ R) ≤ exp()Pr (M (D0 ) ∈ R). If instead for 0 < δ < 1 it holds that Pr (M (D) ∈ R) ≤
exp()Pr (M (D0 ) ∈ R) + δ then the mechanism preserves
the weaker notion of (, δ)-differential privacy.
In Section 4, we recall a number of key mechanisms that
preserve these notions of privacy by virtue of target nonprivate function sensitivity.
The following definition due to Hall et al. (2012) relaxes
the requirement that uniform smoothness of response distribution holds on all pairs of databases, to the requirement
that uniform smoothness holds for likely database pairs.
Definition 4. Randomized mechanism M : Dn → R
responding with values in an arbitrary response set R
preserves (, γ)-random differential privacy,
at
privacy level  > 0 and confidence γ ∈ (0, 1), if
Pr (∀R ⊂ R, Pr (M (D) ∈ R) ≤ e Pr (M (D0 ) ∈ R)) ≥
1 − γ, with the inner probabilities over the mechanism’s
randomization, and the outer probability over neighbouring D, D0 ∈ Dn drawn from some P n+1 . The weaker
(, δ)-DP has analogous definition as (, δ, γ)-RDP.
Remark 5. While strong -DP is ideal, utility may demand
compromise. Precedent exists for weaker privacy, with the
definition of (, δ)-DP wherein on any databases (including
likely ones) a private mechanism may leak sensitive information on low probability responses, forgiven by the additive δ relaxation. (, γ)-RDP offers an alternate relaxation,
where on all but a small γ-proportion of unlikely database
pairs, strong -DP holds—RDP plays a useful role.
Example 6. Consider a database on unbounded positive reals D ∈ Rn+ representing loan default times of

Pain-Free Random Differential Privacy with Sensitivity Sampling

a bank’s
Pn customers, and target release statistic f (D) =
n−1 i=1 Di the sample mean. To -DP privatise scalarvalued f (D) it is natural to look to the Laplace mechanism.
However the mechanism requires a bound on the statistic’s
global sensitivity, impossible under unbounded D. Note
for ∆ > 0, when neighbouring D, D0 satisfy {|f (D) −
f (D0 )| ≤ ∆} then Laplace mechanism M∆, (f (D)) enjoys -DP on that DB pair. Therefore the probability of
the latter event is bounded below by the probability of the
former. Modelling the default times by iid exponential variables of rate λ > 0, then |f (D) − f (D0 )| = |Dn − Dn0 |/n
is distributed as Exp(nλ), and so
Pr (∀t ∈ R, Pr (M∆, (D) = t) ≤ e Pr (M∆, (D0 ) = t))
≥Pr (|f (D) − f (D0 )| ≤ ∆) = 1 − e−λn∆ ≥ 1 − γ ,
provided that ∆ ≥ log(1/γ)/(λn). While -DP fails due
to unboundedness, the data is likely bounded and so the
mechanism is likely strongly private: M∆, is (, γ)-RDP.

3. Problem Statement
We consider a statistician looking to apply a differentiallyprivate mechanism to an f : Dn → B whose sensitivity
cannot easily be bounded analytically (cf. Example 6 or
the case of a computer program).
Instead we assume that the statistician has the ability to
sample from some arbitrary product space P n+1 on Dn+1 ,
can evaluate f arbitrarily (and in particular on the result
of this sampling), and is interested in applying a privatising mechanism with the guarantee of random differential
privacy (Definition 4).
Remark 7. Natural choices for P present themselves for
sampling or defining random differential privacy. P could
be taken as the underlying distribution from which a sensitive DB was drawn—in the case of sensitive training data
but insensitive data source; an alternate test distribution
of interest in the case of domain adaptation; or P could
be uniform or an otherwise non-informative likelihood (cf.
Example 6). Proved in full report (Rubinstein & Aldà,
2017), the following relates RDP of similar distributions.
Proposition 8. Let P, Q be distributions on D with
bounded KL divergence KL(P kQ) ≤ τ . If mechanism
M on databases in Dn is RDP with confidence
p γ > 0 wrt
P then it is also RDP with confidence γ + (n + 1)τ /2
wrt Q, with the same privacy parameters  (or , δ).

4. Sensitivity-Induced Differential Privacy
When a privatising mechanism M is known to achieve
differential privacy for some mapping f : Dn → B
under bounded global sensitivity, then our approach’s
high-probability estimates of sensitivity will imply highprobability preservation of differential privacy. In order to

reason about such arguments, we introduce the concept of
sensitivity-induced differential privacy.
Definition 9. For arbitrary mapping f : Dn → B and
randomised mechanism M∆ : B → R, we say that M∆
is sensitivity-induced -differentially private if for a neighbouring pair of databases D, D0 ∈ Dn , and ∆ ≥ 0
kf (D) − f (D0 )kB ≤ ∆
=⇒

∀R ⊂ R, Pr (M∆ (f (D)) ∈ R)
≤ exp() · Pr (M∆ (f (D0 )) ∈ R)

with the qualification on R being all measurable subsets
of the response set R. In the same vein, the analogous
definition for (, δ)-differential privacy can also be made.
Many generic mechanisms in use today preserve differential privacy by virtue of satisfying this condition. The following are immediate consequences of existing proofs of
differential privacy. First, when a non-private target function f aims to release Euclidean vectors responses.
Corollary 10 (Laplace mechanism). Consider database
D ∈ Dn , normed space B = (Rd , k · k1 ) for d ∈ N, nonprivate function f : Dn → B. The Laplace mechanism1
(Dwork et al., 2006) M∆ (f (D)) ∼ Lap (f (D), ∆/), is
sensitivity-induced -differentially private.
Example 11. Example 6 used Corollary 10 for RDP of the
Laplace mechanism on unbounded bank loan defaults.
Corollary 12 (Gaussian mechanism). Consider database
D ∈ Dn , normed space B = (Rd , k · k2 ) for some
d ∈ N, and non-private function f : Dn → B. The Gaussian mechanism (Dwork & Roth, 2014) M∆ (f (D)) ∼
N (f (D), diag (σ)) with σ 2 > 2∆2 log(1.25/δ)/2 , is
sensitivity-induced (, δ)-differentially private.
Second, f may aim to release elements of an arbitrary set
R, where a score function s(D, ·) benchmarks quality of
potential releases (placing a partial ordering on R).
Corollary 13 (Exponential mechanism). Consider
database D ∈ Dn , response space R, normed
space B = RR , k · k∞ , non-private score function
s : Dn × R → R, and restriction f : Dn → B given by
f (D) = s(D, ·). The exponential mechanism (McSherry
& Talwar, 2007) M∆ (f (D)) ∼ exp ( (f (D)) (r)/2∆),
which when normalised specifies a PDF over responses
r ∈ R, is sensitivity-induced -differentially private.
Third, f could be function-valued as for learning settings,
where given a training set we wish to release a model (e.g.,
classifier or predictive posterior) that can be subsequently
evaluated on (non-sensitive) test points.
Corollary 14 (Bernstein mechanism). Consider database
D ∈ Dn , query space Y = [0, 1]` with constant dimension ` ∈ N, lattice cover of Y of size k ∈ N given by
1

Lap (a, b) has unnormalised PDF exp(−kx − ak1 /b).

Our framework does not apply directly to the objective perturbation mechanism of Chaudhuri et al. (2011), as that
mechanism does not rely directly on a notion of sensitivity of objective function, classifier, or otherwise. However
it can apply to the posterior sampler used for differentiallyprivate Bayesian inference (Mir, 2012; Dimitrakakis et al.,
2014; 2017; Zhang et al., 2016): there the target function
f : Dn → B returns the likelihood function p(D|·), itself
mapping parameters Θ to R; using the result of f (D) and
public prior ξ(θ),R the mechanism samples
from the posteR
rior ξ(B|D) = B p(D|θ)dξ(θ)/ Θ p(D|θ)dξ(θ); differential privacy follows from a Lipschitz condition on f that
would require our sensitivity sampler to sample from all
database pairs—a minor modification left for future work.

5. The Sensitivity Sampler
Algorithm 1 presents the S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER in detail. Consider privacy-insensitive independent sample
D1 , . . . , Dm ∼ P n+1 of databases on n + 1 records, where
P is chosen to match the desired distribution in definition
of random differential privacy. A number of natural choices
are available for P (cf. Remark 7). The main idea of
S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER is that for each extended-database
observation of D ∼ P n+1 , we induce i.i.d. observations
G1 , . . . , Gm ∈ R of the random variable

confidence would invoke higher sensitivity and therefore
lower utility. However as we cannot in general possess
the true CDF, we resort to uniformly approximating it
w.h.p. using the empirical CDF induced by the sample
G1 , . . . , Gm . The guarantee of uniform approximation derives from empirical process theory. Figure 1 provides
further intuition behind S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER. Algorithm 2 presents S AMPLE -T HEN -R ESPOND which composes S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER with any sensitivity-induced
differentially-private mechanism.
Our main result Theorem 15 presents explicit expressions
for parameters m, k that are sufficient to guarantee that
S AMPLE -T HEN -R ESPOND achieves (, δ, γ)-random differential privacy. Under that result the parameter ρ, which
controls the uniform approximation of the empirical CDF
from G1 , . . . , Gm sample to the true CDF, is introduced as
a free parameter. We demonstrate through a series of optimisations in Table 1 how ρ can be tuned to optimise either
sampling effort m, utility via order statistic index k, or privacy confidence γ. These alternative explicit choices for ρ
serve as optimal operating points for the mechanism.
5.1. Practicalities
S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER simplifies the application of differential privacy by obviating the challenge of bounding
sensitivity. As such, it is important to explore any practical
issues arising in its implementation. The algorithm itself
involves few main stages: sampling databases, measuring
sensitivity, sorting, order statistic lookup (inversion), followed by the sensitivity-induced private mechanism.

G = kf (D1...n ) − f (D1...n−1;n+1 )kB .
From these observations of the sensitivity of target mapping f : Dn → B, we estimate w.h.p. sensitivity that
can achieve random differential privacy, for the full suite of
sensitivity-induced private mechanisms discussed above.
If we knew the full CDF of G, we would simply invert
this CDF to determine the level of sensitivity for achieving
any desired γ level of random differential privacy: higher

Sampling. As discussed in Remark 7, a number of natural choices for sampling distribution P could be made.
Where a simulation process exists, capable of generating
synthetic data approximating D, then this could be run. For
example in the Bayesian setting (Dimitrakakis et al., 2014),
one could use a public conditional likelihood p(·|θ), parametric
family Θ, prior ξ(θ) and sample from the marginal
R
p(x|θ)dξ(θ).
Alternatively, it may suffice to sample
Θ
from the uniform distribution on D, or Gaussian restricted
to Euclidean D. In any of these cases, sampling is relatively
straightforward and the choice should consider meaningful
random differential privacy guarantees relative to P .
Sensitivity Measurement. A trivial stage, given neighbouring databases, measurement could involve expanding
a mathematical expression representing a target function,
or a computer program such as running a deep learning or
computer vision open-source package. For some targets,
it may be that running first on one database, covers much
of the computation required for the neighbouring database
in which case amortisation may improve runtime. The cost
of sensitivity measurement will be primarily determined by
sample size m. Note that sampling and measurement can
be trivially parallelised over map-reduce-like platforms.
Sorting, Inversion. Strictly speaking the entire sensitivity
sample need not be sorted, as only one order statistic is required. That said, sorting even millions of scalar measurements can be accomplished in under a second on a stock
machine. An alternative strategy to inversion as presented,
is to take the maximum sensitivity measured so as to maximise privacy without consideration to utility.
Mechanism. It is noteworthy that in settings where mechˆ
anism M∆ is to be run multiple times, the estimation of ∆
need not be redone. As such S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER could
be performed entirely in an offline amortisation stage.

of the Lambert-W function, which is the inverse relation
of the function f (z) = z exp(z), and is implemented as a

Lambert-W is in general a multi-valued relation on the
analytic complex domain, all instances in our results are
single-real-valued functions on the reals. The next result
presents the first operating point’s corresponding rate on effort in terms of privacy, and follows from recent bounds on

privacy and utility are in tension. Effort is naturally decreased by reducing the confidence level of RDP (ρ chosen
to minimise m, or γ). By minimising order statistic index
k, we select smaller Gk and therefore sensitivity estimate
ˆ This in turn leads to lower generic mechanism noise
∆.
and higher utility. All this is achieved by sacrificing effort
or privacy confidence. As usual, sacrificing  or δ privacy
levels also leads to utility improvement. Figures 2 and 3
visualise these operating points.

Less conservative estimates on sensitivity can lead to superior utility while also enjoying easier implementation. This
hypothesis is borne out in experiments in Section 7.
Proposition 18. For any f : Dn → B with global sensitivity ∆ = supD∼D0 kf (D) − f (D0 )kB , S ENSITIVI ˆ ≤ ∆. As a result,
TY S AMPLER ’s random sensitivity ∆
Algorithm 2 run with any of the sensitivity-induced private
mechanisms of Corollaries 10–14 achieves utility dominating that of the respective mechanisms run with ∆.

7. Experiments
We now demonstrate the practical value of S ENSITIVI TY S AMPLER . First in Section 7.1 we illustrate how S EN SITIVITY S AMPLER sensitivity quickly approaches analytical high-probability sensitivity, and how it can be significantly lower than worst-case global sensitivity in Section 7.2. Running privatising mechanisms with lower sensitivity parameters can mitigate utility loss, while maintaining (a weaker form of) differential privacy. We present experimental evidence of this utility savings in Section 7.3.
While application domains may find the alternate balance
towards utility appealing by itself, it should be stressed
that a significant advantage of S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER is
its ease of implementation.

7.2. Global Sensitivity vs. Sampled Sensitivity
Consider now the challenging goal of privately releasing an
SVM classifier fit to sensitive training data. In applying the
Laplace mechanism to releasing the primal normal vector,
Rubinstein et al. (2012) bound the vector’s sensitivity using
algorithmic stability of the SVM. In particular, a lengthy
√
derivation establishes that kwD − wD0 k1 ≤ 4LCκ d/n
for a statistically consistent formulation of the SVM with
convex L-Lipschitz loss, d-dimensional feature mapping
with supx k(x, x) ≤ κ2 , and regularisation parameter C.
While the original work (and others since) did not consider
the practical problem of releasing unregularised bias term
b, we can effectively bound this sensitivity via a short argument in full report (Rubinstein & Aldà, 2017).
Proposition 19. For the SVM run with hinge loss, linear
kernel, D = [0, 1]d , the release
(w, b) has L1 global sensi√
tivity bounded by 2 + 2C d + 4Cd/n.
We train private SVM using the Laplace mechanism (Rubinstein et al., 2012), with global sensitivity bound of
Proposition 19 or S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER. We synthesise a dataset of n = 1000 points, selected with equal
probability of being drawn from the positive class N (0.2 ·
1, diag(0.01)) or negative class N (0.8 · 1, diag(0.01)).
The feature space’s dimension varies from d = 8 through
d = 64. The SVMs are run with C = 3, S ENSITIVI TY S AMPLER with m = 1500 & varying γ. Figure 5 shows
ˆ
very different sensitivities obtained. While estimated ∆
hovers around 0.01 largely independent of γ, global sensitivity ∆ exceeds 20—two orders of magnitude greater.
These patterns are repeated as dimension increases; sensitivity increasing is to be expected since as dimensions are
added, the few points in the training set become more likely
to be support vectors and thus affecting sensitivity. Such
conservative estimates could clearly lead to inferior utility.

7.3. Effect on Utility

cal bounds on global sensitivity (a Lipschitz condition)
on the non-private target. While this sensitivity is trivially derived for simple statistics, for state-of-the-art learners sensitivity derivations are arduous e.g., in collaborative filtering (McSherry & Mironov, 2009), SVMs (Rubinstein et al., 2012; Chaudhuri et al., 2011), model selection (Thakurta & Smith, 2013), feature selection (Kifer
et al., 2012), Bayesian inference (Dimitrakakis et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2015), and deep learning (Abadi et al., 2016).

Support Vector Classification. We return to the same
SVM setup as in the previous section, with d = 2, now
plotting utility as misclassification error (averaged over 500
repeats) vs. privacy budget . Here we set γ = 0.05
and include also the non-private SVM’s performance as a
bound on utility possible. See Figure 6. At very high privacy levels both private SVMs suffer the same poor error.
But quickly with lower privacy, the misclassification error
of S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER drops until it reaches the nonprivate rate. Simultaneously the global sensitivity approach
has a significantly higher value and suffers a much slower
decline. These results suggest that S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER
can achieve much better utility in addition to sensitivity.
Kernel Density Estimation. We finally consider a one dimensional (d = 1) KDE setting. In Figure 7 we show the
error (averaged over 1000 repeats) of the Bernstein mechanism (with lattice size k = 10 and Bernstein order h = 3)
on 5000 points drawn from a mixture of two normal distributions N (0.5, 0.02) and N (0.75, 0.005) with weights
0.4, 0.6, respectively. For this experimental result, we set
m = 50000 and two different values for γ, as displayed
in Figure 7. Once again we observe that for high privacy
levels the global sensitivity approach incurs a higher error
relative to non-private, while S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER provides stronger utility. At lower privacy, both approaches
converge to the approximation error of the Bernstein polynomial used.

While derivations may prevent domain experts from leveraging differential privacy, our S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER
promises to make privatisation simple when using existing
mechanisms including Laplace (Dwork et al., 2006), Gaussian (Dwork & Roth, 2014), exponential (McSherry & Talwar, 2007) and Bernstein (Aldà & Rubinstein, 2017). All
such mechanisms guarantee differential privacy on pairs of
databases for which a level ∆ of non-private function sensitivity holds, when the mechanism is run with that ∆ parameter. For all such mechanisms we leverage results from
empirical process theory to establish guarantees of random
differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012) when using sampled
sensitivities only.
Experiments demonstrate that real-world learners can easily be run privately without any new derivation whatsoever. And by using a naturally-weaker form of privacy,
while replacing worst-case global sensitivity bounds with
estimated (actual) sensitivities, we can achieve far superior
utility than existing approaches.

In this paper we propose S ENSITIVITY S AMPLER, an algorithm for empirical estimation of sensitivity for privatisation of black-box functions. Our work addresses an
important usability gap in differential privacy, whereby
several generic privatisation mechanisms exist complete
with privacy and utility guarantees, but require analyti-
