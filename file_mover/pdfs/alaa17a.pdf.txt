Learning from Clinical Judgments: Semi-Markov-Modulated Marked
Hawkes Processes for Risk Prognosis

Ahmed M. Alaa, 1 Scott Hu, 1 Mihaela van der Schaar 1 2 3

Abstract
Critically ill patients in regular wards are vulnerable to unanticipated adverse events which require prompt transfer to the intensive care unit
(ICU). To allow for accurate prognosis of deteriorating patients, we develop a novel continuoustime probabilistic model for a monitored patient’s temporal sequence of physiological data.
Our model captures “informatively sampled” patient episodes: the clinicians’ decisions on when
to observe a hospitalized patient’s vital signs and
lab tests over time are represented by a marked
Hawkes process, with intensity parameters that
are modulated by the patient’s latent clinical
states, and with observable physiological data
(mark process) modeled as a switching multi-task
Gaussian process. In addition, our model captures “informatively censored” patient episodes
by representing the patient’s latent clinical states
as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The
model parameters are learned from offline patient
episodes in the electronic health records via an
EM-based algorithm. Experiments conducted on
a cohort of patients admitted to a major medical
center over a 3-year period show that risk prognosis based on our model significantly outperforms the currently deployed medical risk scores
and other baseline machine learning algorithms.

1. Introduction
Hospitalized patients are vulnerable to a wide range of
adverse events, including cardiopulmonary arrests (Kause
et al., 2004; Hogan et al., 2012; Yoon et al., 2016), acute
respiratory failures (Mokart, 2013), septic shocks (Henry
et al., 2015), and post-operative complications (Clifton

et al., 2012). For a patient in a regular ward, the occurrence of any such event entails an unplanned transfer to an
intensive care unit (ICU), the timing of which is a major
determinant of the eventual outcome. Indeed, recent medical studies have confirmed that delayed transfer to the ICU
is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality (Mardini L, 2012; Mokart, 2013). The problem of delayed ICU
transfer is enormous and acute: over 750,000 septic shocks
and 200,000 cardiac arrests occur in the U.S. each year with
mortality rates of 28.6% and 75% respectively (Merchant
et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2011). Fortunately, experts believe that much of these events could be prevented with accurate prognosis and early warning (Nguyen et al., 2007).
Motivated by the proliferation of electronic health records
(EHRs) (currently available in more than 75% of hospitals in the U.S. (Charles et al., 2016)) we develop a datadriven real-time risk score that can promptly assess a hospitalized patient’s risk of clinical deterioration. Our risk
score hinges on a novel continuous-time semi-Markovmodulated marked Hawkes process model for a monitored
patient’s episode, i.e. the patient’s evolving (latent) clinical states and her corresponding (observed) physiological
data. With the guidance of critical care experts, we conducted experiments on a dataset for a cohort of criticallyill patients admitted to a major academic medical center.
Results show that our risk score offers significant gains in
the accuracy (and timeliness) of predicting clinical deterioration; our risk score attains a 23% improvement in the
Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC)
as compared to the technology currently deployed in our
medical center. Since it confers a significant prognostic
value in subacute care in wards, the proposed risk score is
currently being installed in our medical center as a replacement for the current technology.
The proposed probabilistic model (based on which our risk
score is computed) captures a hospitalized patient’s entire
episode as recorded in the EHR. A typical (critical care)
patient episode comprises the time of her admission to the
ward, the time of her admission to the ICU or discharge
from the ward, and a temporal sequence of irregularly sampled physiological data that are collected during her stay in
the ward (Johnson, 2016; Ghassemi et al., 2015). We model

Semi-Markov-Modulated Marked Hawkes Processes for Risk Prognosis

a patient’s episode as being driven by a latent clinical state
process, which we represent as a semi-Markov jump process (Yu, 2010), describing the evolution of the patient’s
“severity of illness” over time. All the observable physiological variables are modulated by this process: the times at
which clinicians decide to observe the patient’s physiological data are drawn from a Hawkes point process (Hawkes
& Oakes, 1974), the intensity of which is modulated by the
patient’s clinical state process, whereas the observed physiological data is drawn from a switching multi-task Gaussian process with hyper-parameters that depend on the patient’s clinical state. The patient episode is thus a marked
Hawkes process –with the physiological data serving as the
marks– that is modulated by the patient’s clinical states.
We provide a detailed description of the model in Section
3, and then propose an EM-based algorithm for learning its
parameters from the EHR data in Section 4.
A distinctive feature of our model is its ability to incorporate informative clinical judgments into the generative process for the patient’s episode. The manifestation of informative clinical judgments in the EHR episodes is doublefaceted: the patients’ episodes are both “informatively sampled” and “informatively censored”. Informative sampling
results from the fact that clinicians decide to observe the patient’s physiological data more intensely if they believe that
the patient is in a “bad” clinical state (Moskovitch et al.,
2015; Qin & Shelton, 2015)– a belief that is based on either the clinician’s own assessment of the patient’s state, or
the communication between the patient and the ward staff
(Kyriacos et al., 2014). Informative censoring results from
the clinicians’ decision on when to send the patient to the
ICU or discharge her from the ward, which is indeed informative of the “ clinical deterioration” or “clinical stability”
onsets. In our model, informative censoring is taken into
account by adopting an absorbing semi-Markov chain as a
model for the patient’s latent clinical states; a patient’s risk
score at any point of time is thus defined as the probability
of eventual absorption in a “clinical deterioration” state.
Related work: Marked point processes have been recently
used in a very different context to model check-in data (Du
et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2016), but we are not aware of any
attempts for their deployment in the medical context. Most
of the previous works on risk prognosis for critical care
patients viewed informative censoring as a “surrogate label” for a patient’s clinical deterioration, and hence used
those labels to train a supervised (regression) model using the physiological data in a fixed-size time window before censoring. The supervised models used in the literature included logistic regression (Ho et al., 2012; Saria
et al., 2010), SVMs (Wiens et al., 2012), Gaussian processes (Ghassemi et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2016) and recurrent neural networks (Che et al., 2016). The main limitation
of this approach is that, in addition to the fact that it gener-

ally does not deal with informatively sampled episodes, it
does not model the entire patient’s physiological trajectory,
and hence it does not accurately capture intermediate (subtle) deterioration stages that are indicative of future severe
deterioration stages, which leads to a sluggish risk assessment and delayed ICU alarms.
Another strand of literature has focused on building probabilistic models, usually variants of Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs), for the entire patient’s physiological trajectories;
applications have ranged from disease progression modeling to neonatal sepsis prediction (Wang et al., 2014; Stanculescu et al., 2014). These models are not capable of dealing with irregularly-sampled data, do not deal with informatively sampled episodes, and are restricted to the Markovianity assumption which entails unrealistically memoryless clinical state transitions. In (Henry et al., 2015), a ranking algorithm was used to construct a risk score for sepsis
shocks; however, the approach therein requires the clinicians to provide assessments that order the disease severity
at different time instances– we typically do not have such
data in the EHR for ward patients.
Various works in the medical literature have proposed
“expert-based” medical risk scores for prognosis in hospital wards (Morgan et al., 1997; Parshuram et al., 2009),
some of which are currently used in practice. The medical
literature has also suggested the use of mortality risk scores
that are normally used in the ICU, such as APACHE-II and
SOFA, as risk scores for ward patients (Yu et al., 2014).
However, recent systematic reviews have demonstrated the
modest net clinical utility of all these scores (Cvach, 2012).
More recently, a data-driven medical risk score based on a
simple regression model, known as the Rothman index, has
been developed and commercialized (Finlay et al., 2014;
Rothman et al., 2013). The Rothman index is currently deployed in various major hospitals in the U.S. including our
medical center; in Section 5, we show that our risk score
significantly outperforms the Rothman index in terms of
AUROC and timeliness of ICU admission alarms.

2. Structure of the EHR Data
The subacute care data in an EHR typically comprises a set
of episodes; each episode is a sequence of vital signs and
lab tests (physiological data) that have been gathered (by
clinicians) for a hospitalized patient at irregularly spaced
time instances during her stay in a ward. The episode
starts at the time of admission to the ward, and is concluded by either an unplanned admission to the ICU, which
means that the patient was clinically deteriorating, or a discharge from the ward, which means that the patient was
clinically stable. We denote an EHR dataset D that comprises the episodes for D patients as D = {E d }D
d=1 , where
E d is the episode for the dth patient, and is defined as

d
d d
d
th
d
E d = ({ym
, tdm }M
Qm=1 , Tc , l ), with ym being the m
dimensional physiological variable (vital signs and lab test
outcomes) for patient d observed at time tdm , and the total number of samples observed for that patient during her
episode is Md . The duration of patient d’s stay in the ward
is denoted by Tcd , whereas her endpoint outcome (clinical
deterioration and ICU admission, or clinical stability and
discharge) is declared via a binary variable ld ; the realization ld = 1 means that patient d was admitted to the ICU,
and ld = 0 means that the patient was discharged home.
We stress that the labels ld associated with every episode
are neither noisy nor entirely subjective: we assign a label
ld = 1 for patients who actually needed a therapeutic intervention in the ICU after an unplanned admission, and
assign a label ld = 0 for patients who were discharged and
not re-admitted shortly after. We excluded all post-surgical
ward patients for whom an ICU admission was preordained
since for those patients the prognosis problem is not relevant. Our dataset comprises thousands of episodes for patients admitted to a large medical center over a 3-year period; all the episodes display the structure described above.

The clinicians were right!
Clinical judgments manifest in the dth episode of D
through informative sampling (encoded in the observation
d
times {tdm }M
m=1 ), and informative censoring (encoded in
the episode duration Tcd and the endpoint outcome ld ). Figure 1 is a depiction for both informative sampling and informative censoring. In Figure 1, we estimate the physiological data (time-varying) sampling rate using all the
episodes in our dataset over a time horizon of 35 hours before ICU admission for deteriorating patients (i.e. patients
with ld = 1, with t = 0 being the ICU admission time),
and we compute the same estimates for stable patients (i.e.
patients with ld = 0, with t = 0 being the discharge time).
We can see from the trends in Figure 1 that as the deteriorating patient approaches the ICU admission time, the clinicians tend to sample her physiological data more intensely,
whereas as the stable patient approaches the discharge time,
the clinicians tend to have a more relaxed schedule for observing her vital signs and lab tests. The divergence between the sampling rates for deteriorating and stable patient groups increases as the patients approach their ICU
admission and discharge onsets– that is because the clinicians become less uncertain about the patient’s state as time
progresses. We have tested the hypothesis that the sampling rate of deteriorating patients is –on average– larger
than that for stable patients in the last 24 hours before ICU
admission or discharge via a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05, and the hypothesis was accepted.
The take-away from Figure 1 is that the clinician’s judgment of the patient’s clinical state –manifesting in the vital
signs and lab tests sampling rates– is very predictive of the

endpoint outcomes. This implies that there is a room for
“learning from the informative clinical judgments”; that is,
one can infer the patients’ latent states over time by using the clinicians’ observable sampling patterns as proximal noisy labels for those latent states.

3. The Semi-Markov-Modulated Marked
Hawkes Process Model
Now we present a probabilistic model for the episodes
{E d }D
d=1 that captures the informative sampling and censoring effects discussed in Section 2. We start by modeling
the patient’s latent clinical state process in Subsection 3.1,
before modeling the observable variables in Subsection 3.2.
3.1. Latent Clinical States
We assume that each patient’s episode is governed by an
underlying latent clinical state process X(t) that represents
the evolution of her “clinical well-being” over time. The
patient’s latent clinical state X(t) at any point of time t ∈
R+ (t = 0 corresponds to the time of admission to the
ward) belongs to a finite space X comprising N states, i.e.
X = {1, 2, . ., ., N }. We model informative censoring by
assuming that states 1 and N are absorbing states; state 1
is the state of clinically stability, at which the patient can
be safely discharged home, whereas state N is the state
of clinical deterioration, at which the patient needs to be
admitted to the ICU. Whenever the patient is in state 1 or
N , her episode is terminated by the clinicians shortly after.
All other states in X /{1, N } are transient states in which
the patient needs vigilant monitoring by the ward staff.
The clinical state process X(t) is a semi-Markov jump pro∑K
cess (Yu, 2010), i.e. X(t) =
n=1 Xn · 1{τn ≤t<τn+1 }
is a semi-Markov process for which every new state realization Xn starts at a jump time τn , where τ1 = 0, and
lasts for a random sojourn time Sn = τn+1 − τn . A total
number of K states are realized in the path X(t), where
K is indeed random, and XK ∈ {1, N }, i.e. the patient’s episode is concluded by either clinical deterioration
or stability. The advantage of adopting a semi-Markovian
model for the clinical state process is that unlike Marko-

vian models, semi-Markovianity does not imply memoryless transitions– the transition probability from one clinical
state to another at any time depends on the time spent in the
current state, a property that has been recently validated in
various clinical state models (Taghipour et al., 2013). We
adopt an explicit-duration model for the state sojourn times
(Johnson & Willsky, 2013): the nth state sojourn time Sn
is drawn from a Gamma distribution1 with state-specific
parameters as follows

episode E: the marked point process {(ym , tm )}m∈N+
comprises an observation process {tm }m∈N+ , which represents the physiological variables’ sampling times, and a
mark process {ym }m∈N+ , which represents the realized
physiological variables at these sampling times. The distributional specifications of our marked point process are
given in the following Subsections.

Sn |(Xn = i) ∼ Gamma(γi ), ∀i ∈ X .

We model the observation process generating the physiological variables’ observation times {tm }m∈N+ as a doubly
stochastic point process whose intensity, λ(t), is a stochastic process modulated by the latent clinical state process
X(t). In particular, the observation process {tm }m∈N+ is
modeled as a one-dimensional Hawkes process with a linear self-exciting intensity function λ(t, X(t)) (Lee et al.,
2016), i.e.
∑
λ(t, X(t) = i) = λoi + αi
e−βi (t−tm ) , (3)

(1)

Since the model includes two absorbing states (1 and N )
for which the notion of sojourn time is inapplicable, we
define the variables Sn of such states as the clinicians’ “response times” for admitting patients to the ICU or discharging them upon the clinical deterioration/stability onset. The
transitions among clinical states are governed by a semiMarkov transition kernel matrix P = (pij )i,j , i.e.
P(Xn+1 = j|Xn = i) = pij ,

where self-transitions are eliminated for all transient states

1, ∀i ∈ {1, N }. The initial state distribution is given by
π = (πi )N

E d in an EHR dataset D is associated with a latent clinical

n=1 , but we can only observe the
absorbing state realization XK d = ld in the EHR data.
3.2. Observable Physiological Data
The patient’s latent clinical state process X(t) manifests in
two ways: (1) it modulates the intensity of sampling the patient’s physiological variables (informative sampling), and
(2) it modulates the distributional properties of the observed physiological variables. We capture these two effects via a marked point process model for the patient’s
1

We model the sojourn time via a Gamma distribution since
it encompasses memoryless exponential distributions of Markov
models as a special case (Liu et al., 2015).

∀ i ∈ X ,, where λoi , αi and βi are the state-dependent intensity parameters, e−βi (t−tm ) is an exponential triggering kernel, and τ < t is the time of the most recent jump
in X(t). In order to ensure the local stationarity of the
Hawkes process within the sojourn time of every latent
state, we assume that αβii < 1, ∀i ∈ X (Roueff et al.,
2016); the expected value of the intensity function is thereλo
fore given by E[λ(t, X(t) = i)] = 1− iαi . For βi = ∞
βi

or αi = 0, we recover a modulated Poisson process as a
special case (Pan et al., 2016).
In Figure 2, we depict the observation times in two patients’
episodes: patient A being a clinically deteriorating patient,
and patient B being a clinically stable patient. We can see
that patient A’s episode had its sampling rate escalating as
her condition was worsening; the sampling rate remained
intense after she was admitted to the ICU. On the other
hand, patient B’s episode exhibited a decelerating sampling
rate on her path to clinical stability. We can also notice that

Semi-Markov-Modulated Marked Hawkes Processes for Risk Prognosis

the observation times display a subtle “clustered” pattern
that point out to their temporal dependencies– indeed, the
clinicians are not memoryless, and the times at which they
observe the physiological data are dependent. In the light of
the above, the modulated Hawkes process described above
appears to be a sensible model for the observation process
{tm }m∈N+ as it captures both the time-varying intensity
and the temporal dependencies illustrated in Figure 2.
3.2.2. T HE M ARK P ROCESS
Now we provide the distributional specification of the mark
process {ym }m∈N+ . Since the physiological data are irregularly sampled from an underlying continuous-time physiological process Y (t) at the sampling times determined by
the observation process {tm }m∈N+ , a convenient model for
Y (t) is a switching Gaussian Process defined as follows:
∑K
Y (t) = n=1 Yn (t)1{τn ≤t<τn+1 } , with
Yn (t)|(Xn = i) ∼ GP(mi (t), ki (t, t′ )),

(4)

where mi (t) and ki (t, t′ ) are the state-dependent mean
function and covariance kernel, respectively. We use a constant mean function mi (t) = mi and a Matérn kernel given
by
(√
ki (t, t′ ) =

2vi −1 |t−t′ |

)vi − 12

(√

)
,

(5)
where vi ∈ N+ , ℓi ∈ R+ , Γ(.) is the Gamma function and
Kvi − 12 (.) is a modified Bessel function (Rasmussen, 2006).
Our choice for the Matérn kernel is motivated by its ability
to represent various commonly used stochastic processes;
for instance, when vi = 1, then Yn (t)|(Xn = i) is an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Rasmussen, 2006), whereas
for a general integer value of vi , Yn (t)|(Xn = i) is a
continuous-time analogue of the Auto-regressive process
AR(vi )– a process that has been widely used to model
physiological time-series data (Stanculescu et al., 2014).
By constructing Yn (t) as a continuous-time analog of the
∑K
AR model, the process Y (t) = n=1 Yn (t)1{τn ≤t≤τn+1 }
becomes a continuous-time switching AR model that is
modulated by the patient’s latent clinical state process
X(t). We observe the continuous-time process Y (t) only
at the sampling times dictated by the observation process
(tm )m∈N+ , and the resulting process {ym }m∈N+ defines
the mark process. The observation process together with
the mark process, both modulated by the latent clinical state
process X(t), constitute a marked Hawkes process, which
completely describes a patient’s episode.
The mark process defined above is one-dimensional, and
hence we need to extend the definition to handle a multidimensional process that represents multiple lab tests and

vital signs. In other words, we seek a continuous-time analog of the switching Vector Auto-regressive (VAR) model
rather than an AR model2 . This is achieved by adopting a multi-task Gaussian Process as a model for the Qdimensional physiological process Y (t) ∈ RQ (Durichen
et al., 2015). That is, we assume that Yn (t)|(Xn =
i) ∼ GP(mi (t), Ki (t, t′ )), where the covariance kernel
Ki (t, t′ ) = {ki (r, g, t, t′ )}Q
r,g=1 is based on the intrinsic
correlation model (Bonilla et al., 2007), i.e. Ki (t, t′ ) can
be written in the following separable form
ki (r, g, t, t′ ) = Σi (r, g) · ki (t, t′ ),

(6)

where ki (r, g, t, t′ ) is the covariance between the rth physiological variable at time t and the g th physiological variable at time t′ , Σi is a Q × Q intrinsic correlation matrix, and ki (t, t′ ) is the Matérn kernel in (5). For every state i, we denote the multi-task GP parameter set as
Θi = (mi (t), Ki (t, t′ )), and the Hawkes process parameter set as Λi . The entire model parameters can be bundled
in the parameter set Ω as follows
Ω = {P, (πi , γi , Λi , Θi )i∈X }.
Given a parameter set Ω, we can easily generate sample
patient episodes from our model by first sampling a state
sequence {X1 , . . ., XK } using the semi-Markov transition
kernel, then sampling a corresponding sequence of sojourn
times {S1 , . . ., SK } from the state-dependent Gamma distributions, then sampling a set of multi-task Gaussian process {Y1 (t), . . ., YK (t)}, and finally sampling a sequence
of observation times {tm }M
m=1 using Ogata’s modified thinning algorithm (Ogata, 1981). Figure 3 depicts one patient
episode sampled from our model. (An algorithm for sampling episodes from our model is provided in Appendix B
in the supplementary material.)

4. Learning and Inference
In this Section, we develop an offline learning algorithm
that learns the model parameter Ω using the offline training
episodes in D, and a real-time risk scoring algorithm that
computes a hospitalized patient’s risk over time. The learning algorithm operates by first detecting change-points in
the physiological data and the observation process; using
the detected change-points, the algorithm segments each
episode into a sequence of states, and uses an EM algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The real-time risk
scoring algorithm operates by inferring the patient’s current
state via forward-filtering, and then computing the probability of eventual absorption in the deteriorating state.

In Appendix A of the supplementary material, we establish
the connection between the switching multi-task Gaussian Process model described herein and the conventional VAR model,
showing that the former is the continuous-time analog of the latter.

4.1. The Offline Learning Algorithm
Estimating the model parameters Ω from the dataset D =
{E d }D
d=1 is a daunting task due to the hiddenness of the
patients’ clinical state trajectories {Xnd , Snd }D
d=1 ; an application of MCMC-based inference methods, such as the
method in (Qin & Shelton, 2015), will incur an excessive computational cost for a complex model like ours.
We therefore developed an efficient three-step learning algorithm that capitalizes on the structure of the patients’
episodes in order to find a point estimate Ω̂ for Ω. The three
steps of the our learning algorithm are listed hereunder3 .
Step 1: Change-point detection
d
We first estimate the jump times {τ1d , . . ., τK
d } for evd
ery episode E in D. This is achieved by using the
E-divisive change-point detection algorithm (Matteson &
James, 2014). Since the E-divisive algorithm is nonparametric, we are able to estimate the onsets of all clinical
states, i.e. the jump times of X d (t), prior to finding the
estimate Ω̂. We let the E-divisive algorithm jointly detect changes in the distributions of the observable variables
d Md
d
{ym
}m=1 and the observation process {tdm }M
m=1 by creating an augmented vector of observables that comprises
both the physiological observations and a “differential” observation process, i.e.
d

d
{τ̂1d , . . ., τ̂K
d } = E-divisive((y1 , ∆t1 ), . . ., (yM d , ∆tM d )),

where ∆tdm = tdm − tdm−1 , with ∆td1 = 0. By the end of
this step, we obtain an estimate for the start and end times
of all clinical state realizations for every episode E d .
Step 2: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the
absorbing states’ parameters
By virtue of informative censoring, we know the identities
d
d
of all the absorbing states, i.e. XK
d = l , ∀d. Now that
we have estimates for the onsets of the absorbing states,
obtained from step 1, then we can estimate the response

The details for all the algorithms in this Section are provided
in Appendix C in the supplementary material.

∀i ∈ {0, 1}. Given such a fully fledged specification of the
absorbing states’ onsets, identities, and the corresponding
physiological variables, we can directly apply MLE to estimate the parameters Θ1 , ΘN , γ1 , γN , Λ1 and ΛN . Using
the dataset Di , the parameter Θi is estimated using the gradient method for Gaussian processes as in (Bonilla et al.,
2007), γi is estimated using the standard MLE estimating
equations, and Λi is estimated by maximizing the recursive
likelihood formula in (Ogata, 1981) using the Nelder-Mead
simplex method (Nelder & Mead, 1965).
Step 3: Estimation of the transient states’ parameters using the EM algorithm
While the absorbing states are observable, the transient
states are all hidden. In order to estimate the parameters

in order to segment every episode d into a set of finite transition, and hence we obtain a discrete-time HMM-like process. We truncate all the episodes by removing the data
belonging to the absorbing state, and run the EM algorithm
in order to estimate the transient state parameters. The EM
algorithm takes advantage of informative censoring in the
forward-backward message passing stage by computing the
backward messages conditioned on the identity of the endpoint absorbing state ld for every episode d.
4.2. The Real-time Risk Scoring Algorithm
Having learned the model parameters Ω̂ from an offline
dataset D, we now explain how risk scoring is conducted
in real-time for a newly hospitalized patient. The patient
risk score at time t is denoted by R(t), and is defined as
R(t) = P(X(∞) = N | {ym , tm }, tm ≤ t, Ω̂). That is,
the risk score R(t) is the probability of being eventually
absorbed in the deteriorating state N given the observable
physiological data up to time t. Using Bayes’ rule, the risk
score R(t) is given by
∑
P(X(t) = i | {ym , tm }) · P(X(∞) = N | X(t) = i),

where the “current state” term is computed in real-time using the efficient (dynamic programming) forward-filtering
algorithm, whereas the “future transition” term is computed

5.1. Data Description

5.2. Results
We ran the offline learning algorithm in Subsection 4.1
(with 1000 EM iterations) on the 5,000 training episodes
in D, and obtained an estimate Ω̂ for the semi-Markovmodulated marked Hawkes process that describes the patient cohort. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we
selected an instantiation of our model with 4 clinical states,
where state 1 is the clinical stability (absorbing) state, and
state 4 is the clinical deterioration (absorbing) state. The

states are given by

Each patient record in D is an episode that is formatted
as described in Section 2. The patients’ cohort in D is
very heterogeneous; diagnoses included sepsis, hypertension, renal failure, leukemia, septicemia and pneumonia.
Each patient’s episode in D comprises 21 vital signs and lab
tests that are collected for the patient over time, along with
the time instances at which they where collected. The vital
signs include diastolic and systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma scale score, heart rate, eye opening, respiratory
rate, temperature, O2 saturation and device assistance, best
motor and verbal responses. The lab tests included measurements of chloride, glucose, urea nitrogen, white blood
cell count, creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count, potassium, sodium and CO2 . In all the experiments conducted in
this Section, we split D into a training set with admissions
over a 2.5-year period (5,000 episodes) and a testing set
with admissions over a 6-month period (1,094 episodes).

where λ(t, X(t)) is measured in samples per hour. We
note that the estimated Hawkes process parameters accurately describe the clinicians’ judgments; when the patient
is in the deteriorating state (state 4), the clinicians tend to
observe her physiological measurements more frequently.
This manifests in the baseline intensity of λ(t, 4) being

50% higher than that of λ(t, 1). Moreover, we note that
when the patient is clinically stable (state 1), the temporal
dependencies between the observation times almost disappear as the exponential triggering kernel plays little role
in determining the observation times, i.e. λ(t, 1) ≈ 0.55,
which renders the observation process closer to a Poisson process. Contrarily, when the patient is deteriorating,
strong temporal dependencies are displayed in the observation times– this is intuitive since for a deteriorating patient,
the follow-up times decided by the clinicians strongly depend on what have been observed in the past. These distinguishing state-specific features of the clinical judgments
are the essence of informative sampling, which allows us
to integrate physiological data together with clinical experience while learning the patient’s physiological model.
We illustrate the value of informative sampling in Figure 4
through an episode for a cardiac patient who was admitted
in the ward for 1 week before being sent to the ICU upon a
cardiac arrest. When running the offline learning algorithm
in Section 4.1 while assuming that the observation process
{tdm }m is uninformative (i.e. λ(t, i) = λ(t, j), ∀i, j ∈ X ),
the detected clinical deterioration onset is only 10 hours
ahead of the cardiac arrest event (onset (2) in Figure 4):
this is because the states are estimated solely based on
the physiological data, and hence the clinical deterioration
state is detected only when the patient’s heart rate fell below 60 beats per minute (BPM). When running the learning again but with informative sampling taken into account,
the detected clinical deterioration onset is 40 hours ahead
of the cardiac arrest event (onset (1) in Figure 4); this is
the time instance at which the clinicians decided to monitor the patient more vigilantly (i.e. more intense sampling
rate) even though the evidence for an upcoming cardiac
arrest in her heart rate trajectory was rather subtle. The
clinicians’ decision to intensely observe the patient’s physiological trajectory is based either on their experience, or
on apparent symptoms or complains from the patient that
were not recorded in the EHR. By integrating the clinicians’ judgments into our model, we are able to capture the
subtleties in the patients’ temporal physiological parameters, and hence learn more accurate representations for the
clinical states.

ROC. As we can see, the proposed risk score offers a 23%
AUROC improvement as compared to the best performing medical risk score –the Rothman index– which was the
score deployed in our medical center at the time of conducting this experiment. Moreover, our risk score also provides
significant gains over discriminative sliding-window regression models; the proposed risk score achieves a 11.5%
AUROC improvement as compared to the best performing ML algorithm (random forest). In addition, the proposed risk score achieves a 16% AUROC improvement as
compared to a standard HMM with Gaussian emission variables5 . On average, our risk score prompts ICU alarms 8
hours before the censoring time at a sensitivity of 50% and
precision of 35%.

6. Discussion: Chicken-and-egg
We then computed the real-time risk score (as described
in Subsection 4.2) for the testing episodes, and compared
its sensitivity-precision AUCROC with that of the baseline
risk scoring methods listed hereunder.
Medical Risk Scores: we considered the two most
commonly used medical risk scores in regular wards– the
MEWS score (Morgan et al., 1997) and the Rothman index4 (Rothman et al., 2013). We implemented the MEWS
score and the Rothman index as described in (Kyriacos
et al., 2014) and (Rothman et al., 2013), respectively. We
also compared with the APACHE-II and SOFA scores.
Machine Learning Algorithms: we considered the
traditional approach for real-time risk scoring, which treats
informative censoring as a surrogate label based on which
a supervised regression model is learned offline, and then
risk scoring is applied in real-time using the temporal data
within a sliding window– we call these methods “slidingwindow methods”. We implemented sliding-window
methods based on logistic regression (Ho et al., 2012;
Saria et al., 2010), random forests, and Gaussian process
regression (Ghassemi et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2016).
In addition, we compared our risk score with a standard
Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian emissions. The
relevant physiological measurements for every baseline
were selected through the correlated feature selection
method (Yu & Liu, 2003). The hyper-parameters of all
the baselines, including the size of the sliding window
for the supervised learning methods, were optimized via
cross-validation. To handle the irregularly sampled data,
we discretized the time horizon into 1-hour steps and fed
the baselines with interpolated, discrete-time episodes.
In Table 1, we compare the performance of our risk score
with the baselines in terms of the sensitivity-precision AU4
At the time of conducting these experiments, the Rothman
index was deployed in more than 60 major hospitals in the US.

We stress that while computing our risk score for the testing episodes, we did not use the information conveyed in
the observation process {tdm }m to infer the patients’ clinical states. This is because in practice, the value of the realtime risk score R(t) itself influences the clinician’s behavior and hence impacts the observation process, creating a
chicken-and-egg dilemma in which one cannot clearly conceptualize the causal relation between the risk score and the
clinicians’ judgments. A very interesting research direction
is to consider an observation process that is modulated by
both the patient’s state and the real-time risk score through
an intensity function λ(t, X(t), R(t)), where the algorithm
learns the clinical state representation online by “sharing
experience” with the clinicians. That is, the algorithm uses
the clinician’s judgments to refine its clinical state model,
which leads to a refined risk score R(t) that would in turn
allow the clinician to exhibit more accurate judgments; an
online learning process that would ideally converge to a
state of “shared knowledge” between the clinician and the
system.
The significant prognostic value offered by our risk score
promises a great improvement in the quality of subacute
care in wards. By utilizing the proposed score instead of
the current technology, clinicians in a crowded ward can
better focus their attention on patients at real risk of deterioration, and can also plan for timely ICU admissions and effective therapeutic interventions. With the high in-hospital
mortality rates in wards, deploying our risk score may help
save thousands of lives annually– we are currently working
towards installing the proposed risk score in our medical
center.
5
The adoption of a semi-Markovian model for the clinical state
process protects our model from the overtly rapid state switching
behavior that is introduced by memoryless HMMs (Matteson &
James, 2014).
