Follow the Moving Leader in Deep Learning

Shuai Zheng 1 James T. Kwok 1

Abstract
Deep networks are highly nonlinear and difficult
to optimize. During training, the parameter iterate may move from one local basin to another,
or the data distribution may even change. Inspired by the close connection between stochastic optimization and online learning, we propose a variant of the follow the regularized
leader (FTRL) algorithm called follow the moving leader (FTML). Unlike the FTRL family
of algorithms, the recent samples are weighted
more heavily in each iteration and so FTML can
adapt more quickly to changes. We show that
FTML enjoys the nice properties of RMSprop
and Adam, while avoiding their pitfalls. Experimental results on a number of deep learning
models and tasks demonstrate that FTML converges quickly, and outperforms other state-ofthe-art optimizers.

1. Introduction
Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful and
popular class of machine learning algorithms. Well-known
examples include the convolutional neural network (LeCun et al., 1998), long short term memory (Hochreiter
& Schmidhuber, 1997), memory network (Weston et al.,
2014), and deep Q-network (Mnih et al., 2015). These
models have achieved remarkable performance on various
difficult tasks such as image classification (He et al., 2016),
speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013), natural language
understanding (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al.,
2015), and game playing (Silver et al., 2016).
Deep network is a highly nonlinear model with typically
millions of parameters (Hinton et al., 2006). Thus, it is
imperative to design scalable and effective solvers. How1

ever, training deep networks is difficult as the optimization can suffer from pathological curvature and get stuck
in local minima (Martens, 2010). Moreover, every critical point that is not a global minimum is a saddle point
(Kawaguchi, 2016), which can significantly slow down
training. Second-order information is useful in that it reflects local curvature of the error surface. However, a direct computation of the Hessian is computationally infeasible. Martens (2010) introduced Hessian-free optimization,
a variant of truncated-Newton methods that relies on using the linear conjugate gradient to avoid computing the
Hessian. Dauphin et al. (2014) proposed to use the absolute Hessian to escape from saddle points. However, these
methods still require higher computational costs.
Recent advances in deep learning optimization focus
mainly on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Bottou,
1998) and its variants (Sutskever et al., 2013). However,
SGD requires careful stepsize tuning, which is difficult as
different weights have vastly different gradients (in terms
of both magnitude and direction). On the other hand, online learning (Zinkevich, 2003), which is closely related
to stochastic optimization, has been extensively studied in
the past decade. Well-known algorithms include follow the
regularized leader (FTRL) (Kalai & Vempala, 2005), follow the proximally-regularized leader (FTPRL) (McMahan
& Streeter, 2010) and their variants (Duchi & Singer, 2009;
Duchi et al., 2011; Shalev-Shwartz, 2012; Xiao, 2010).
In particular, adaptive gradient descent (Adagrad) (Duchi
et al., 2011) uses an adaptive per-coordinate stepsize. On
convex problems, it has been shown both theoretically and
empirically that Adagrad is especially efficient on highdimensional data (Duchi et al., 2011; McMahan et al.,
2013). When used on deep networks, Adagrad also demonstrates significantly better performance than SGD (Dean
et al., 2012). However, in Adagrad, the variance estimate
underlying the adaptive stepsize is based on accumulating
all past (squared) gradients. This becomes infinitesimally
small as training proceeds. In more recent algorithms,
such as RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) and Adam
(Kingma & Ba, 2015), the variance is estimated by an exponentially decaying average of the squared gradients.
Another problem with the FTRL family of algorithms is
that in each round, the learner has to solve an optimization
problem that considers the sum of all previous gradients.

Follow the Moving Leader in Deep Learning

For highly nonconvex models such as the deep network,
the parameter iterate may move from one local basin to another. Gradients that are due to samples in the distant past
are less informative than those from the recent ones. In
applications where the data distribution is changing (as in
deep reinforcement learning), this may impede parameter
adaptation to the environment.
To alleviate this problem, we propose a FTPRL variant that
reweighs the learning subproblems in each iteration. The
proposed algorithm, which will be called follow the moving leader (FTML), shows strong connections with popular deep learning optimizers such as RMSprop and Adam.
Experiments on various deep learning models demonstrate
that FTML outperforms or at least has comparable convergence performance with state-of-the-art solvers.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 first
gives a brief review on FTRL and other solvers for deep
learning. Section 3 presents the proposed FTML. Experimental results are shown in Section 4, and the last section
gives some concluding remarks.

presented in (Duchi et al., 2011). Gradient descent style algorithms like online forward and backward splitting (FOBOS) (Duchi & Singer, 2009) and adaptive gradient descent (Adagrad) (Duchi et al., 2011) can also be expressed
as special cases of the FTRL family (McMahan, 2011).

the regularization is centered at the origin. McMahan &
Streeter (2010) generalizes this to FTPRL by centering regularization at each iterate θi−1 as in online gradient descent
and online mirror descent (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006),

2.1. Follow the Regularized Leader and its Variants
In online learning, the learner observes a sequence of functions fi ’s, which can be deterministic, stochastic, or even
adversarially chosen. Let Θ ⊆ Rd be a convex compact
set. At round t, the learner picks a predictor θt−1 ∈ Θ,
and the adversary picks a loss ft . The learner then suffers
a loss ft (θt−1 ). The goal of the learner is to minimize the
cumulative loss suffered over the course of T rounds. In
online convex learning, ft is assumed to be convex.
Two popular online learning algorithms are the follow the regularized leader (FTRL) (Kalai & Vempala,
2005; Shalev-Shwartz, 2012), and its variant follow
the proximally-regularized leader (FTPRL) (McMahan
&

Streeter, 2010). Both achieve the optimal O( T ) regret,
where T is the number of rounds (Shalev-Shwartz, 2012).
Other FTRL-like algorithms include regularized dual aver-

2.2. Adaptive Learning Rate in Deep Learning
In training deep networks, different weights may have
vastly different gradients (in terms of both magnitude and
direction). Hence, using a per-coordinate learning rate as in
Adagrad can significantly improve performance over standard SGD (Dean et al., 2012). However, a caveat is that
Adagrad suffers from diminishing stepsize. As optimiza2
tion proceeds, the accumulated squared gradient g1:t
in (5)
becomes larger and larger, making training difficult.
To alleviate this problem, a number of algorithms have
been proposed (Zeiler, 2012; Tieleman & Hinton, 2012;
Kingma & Ba, 2015). Typically, they employ
Pt an average of
the past squared gradients (i.e., vt = i=1 αi,t gi2 , where
αi,t ∈ [0, 1]), which is exponentially decaying. For example, RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) uses
vi = βvi−1 + (1 − β)gi2 ,

(6)

Zeiler (2012) further argues that the parameter and update
should have the same unit, and modifies (7) to the Adadelta
update rule:
√

ut−1 + 1
θt = θt−1 − diag
gt ,
√
vt + 1
Pt−1
where ut−1 = i=0 αi,t−1 (4θi )2 , and 4θt = θt − θt−1
with 4θ0 = 0.
As v0 in (6) is often initialized to 0, the bias has to be
corrected. Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) uses the variance estimate vt /(1 − β t ) (which corresponds to αi,t =
(1 − β)β t−i /(1 − β t )).
Another recent proposal is the equilibrated stochastic gradient descent (Dauphin et al., 2015). It uses the variance
estimate vt = vt−1 + (Ht ζt )2 , where Ht is the Hessian and
ζt ∼ N (0,p
1). It is shown that (Ht ζt )2 is an unbiased estimator of diag(Ht2 ), which serves as the Jacobi preconditioner of the absolute Hessian. Computation of the Hessian can be avoided by using the R-operator (Schraudolph,
2002), though it still costs roughly twice that of standard
backpropagation.

3. Follow the Moving Leader
Recall that at round t, FTRL generates the next iterate θt as

Pi (θ),

3.1. Weighting the Components
To alleviate this problem, one may consider only Pi ’s in
a recent window. However, a large memory is needed for
its implementation. A simpler alternative is by using an
exponential moving average of the Pi ’s: Si = β1 Si−1 +
(1 − β1 )Pi , where β1 ∈ [0, 1) and
PtS0 = 0. This can be
easily rewritten as St = (1 − β1 ) i=1 β1t−i Pi . Instead of
minimizing (8), we have
θt = arg min
θ∈Θ

where β is close to 1, and the corresponding αi,t is (1 −
2
β)β t−i . This vt can then be used to replace g1:t
, and the
update in (4) becomes


η

(7)
θt = θt−1 − diag √
vt + 1

θt = arg min

where Pi (θ) = hgi , θi + 21 kθ − θi−1 k2Qi . Note that all
Pi ’s have the same weight. However, for highly nonconvex
models such as the deep network, the parameter iterate may
move from one local basin to another. Pi ’s that are due to
samples in the distant past are less informative than those
from the recent ones.

where the weights

are normalized to sum to 1. The denominator 1 − β1t plays
a similar role as bias correction in Adam. When β1 = 0,
wi,t = 0 for i < t, and wt,t = 1. Thus, (9) reduces
to minθ∈Θ Pt (θ). When β1 → 1, the following Lemma
shows that all Pi ’s are weighted equally, and (8) is recovered.
Lemma 1. limβ1 →1 wi,t = 1/t.
Note that P
the Hessian of the objective in (8) is Q1:t . This
t
becomes i=1 wi,t Qi in (9). Recall that Q1:t depends on
the accumulated past gradients in (5), which is then refined
by an exponential moving average in (6). As in Adam, we
define vi = β2 vi−1 + (1 − β2 )gi2 , where β2 ∈ [0, 1) and
v0 = 0, and then correct its bias by dividing by 1 − β2t .

σi encourage the corresponding entries of θ to move away

from the definitions of

Hence, the objective in (13) is still strongly convex. Moreover, the following Proposition shows that θt in (13) has a

positive semidefinite matrix A.
The proposed procedure, which will be called follow the
moving leader (FTML), is shown in Algorithm 1. Note
that though {P1 , . . . , Pt } are considered in each round, the
update depends only the current gradient gt and parameter
θt−1 . It can be easily seen that FTML is easy to implement,
memory-efficient and has low per-iteration complexity.
3.2. Relationships with Adagrad, RMSprop and Adam
3.2.1. R ELATIONSHIP WITH A DAGRAD
The following Propositions show that we can recover Adagrad in two extreme cases: (i) β1 = 0 with decreasing stepsize; and (ii) β1 → 1 with increasing stepsize.

t = / t, we recover (1) with Qi in (3). If Θ = R , it
generates identical updates as Adagrad in (4).
3.2.2. R ELATIONSHIP WITH RMS PROP
When Θ = Rd , McMahan (2011) showed that (1) and (2)
generate the same updates. The following Theorem shows
that FTML also has a similar gradient descent update.
Theorem 1. With Θ = Rd , FTML generates the same updates as:

When β1 = 0 and bias correction for the variance is not
used, (14) reduces to RMSprop in (7). However, recall
from Section 3.1 that when β1 = 0, we have wi,t = 0
for i < t, and wt,t = 1. Hence, only the current loss
component Pt is taken into account, and this may be sensitive to the noise in Pt . Moreover, as demonstrated in
Adam, bias correction of the variance can be very important.

size, leading to divergence. In contrast, FTML’s Qi in (12)
recovers that of Adagrad in this case (Proposition 4). In
practice, a smaller β2 has to be used for RMSprop. However, a larger β2 enables the algorithm to be more robust to
the gradient noise in general.
3.2.3. R ELATIONSHIP WITH A DAM
At iteration t, instead of centering regularization at each
θi−1 in (13), consider centering all the proximal regularization terms at the last iterate θt−1 . θt then becomes:

Pt
As in Adam,
i=1 wi,t gi in (16) can be obtained as
mt /(1−β1t ), where mt is computed as an exponential moving average of gt ’s: mt = β1 mt−1 + (1 − β1 )gt .
Note that the θt updates of Adagrad (4), RMSprop (7), and
FTML (14) depend only on the current gradient
Ptgt . On the
other hand, the Adam update in (16) involves i=1 wi,t gi ,
which contains all the past gradients (evaluated at past parameter estimates θi−1 ’s). This is similar to the use of momentum, which is sometimes helpful in escaping from local
minimum. However, when the data distribution is changing
(as in deep reinforcement learning), the past gradients may
not be very informative, and can even impede parameter
adaptation to the environment. Recently, it is also reported
that the use of momentum can make training unstable when
the loss is nonstationary (Arjovsky et al., 2017). Indeed,
Theorem 4.1 in (Kingma & Ba, 2015) shows that Adam
has low regret
Pt only when β1 is decreasing w.r.t. t. When
β1 → 0, i=1 wi,t gi → gt and so only the current gradient
is used.
Remark 1. (Summary) RMSprop and Adam are improvements over Adagrad in training deep networks. However,
RMSprop uses β1 = 0 (and thus relies only on the current
sample), does not correct the bias of the variance estimate,
but centers the regularization at the current iterates θi−1 ’s.
On the other hand, Adam uses β1 > 0, bias-corrected variance, but centers all regularization terms at the last iterate
θt−1 . The proposed FTML combines the nice properties of
the two.

4. Experiments
In this section, experiments are performed on a number of deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (Section 4.1), deep residual networks (Section 4.2), memory networks (Section 4.3), neural conversational model (Section 4.4), deep Q-network (Section 4.5),
and long short-term memory (LSTM) (Section 4.6). A
summary of the empirical performance of the various deep
learning optimizers is presented in Section 4.7.
The following state-of-the-art optimizers for deep learning models will be compared: (i) Adam (Kingma &
Ba, 2015); (ii) RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012);
(iii) Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012); and (iv) Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) (Sutskever et al., 2013). For
FTML, we set β1 = 0.6, β2 = 0.999, and a constant t =  = 10−8 for all t. For FTML, Adam,
RMSprop, and NAG, η is selected by monitoring performance on the training set (note that Adadelta does
not need to set η). The learning rate is chosen from
{0.5, 0.25, 0.1, . . . , 0.00005, 0.000025, 0.00001}. Significantly underperforming learning rates are removed after
running the model for 5 − 20 epochs. We then pick the rate
that leads to the smallest final training loss.

4.1. Convolutional Neural Networks
In the section, we perform experiments with the convolutional neural network (CNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). We use
the example models on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets
from the Keras library1 . For MNIST, the CNN has two alternating stages of 3 × 3 convolution filters (using ReLU
activation), followed by a 2 × 2 max-pooling layer and a
dropout layer (with a dropout rate of 0.25). Finally, there is
a fully-connected layer with ReLU activation and a dropout
rate of 0.5. For CIFAR-10, the CNN has four alternating
stages of 3 × 3 convolution filters (using ReLU activation).
Every two convolutional layers is followed by a 2 × 2 maxpooling layer and a dropout layer (with a dropout rate of
0.25). The last stage has a fully-connected layer with ReLU
activation and a dropout rate of 0.5. Features in both data
sets are normalized to [0, 1]. Minibatches of sizes 128 and
32 are used for MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively.
As the iteration complexities of the various algorithms are
comparable and the total cost is dominated by backpropagation, we report convergence of the training cross entropy
loss versus the number of epochs. This setup is also used
in (Zeiler, 2012; Kingma & Ba, 2015).
Figure 1 shows the convergence results. As can be seen,
FTML performs best on both data sets. Adam has comparable performance with FTML on MNIST, but does not
perform as well on CIFAR-10. The other methods are much
inferior. In particular, RMSprop is slow on both MNIST and
CIFAR-10, and Adadelta tends to diverge on CIFAR-10.
4.2. Deep Residual Networks
Recently, substantially deeper networks have been popularly used, particularly in computer vision. For example, a 152-layer deep residual network (He et al., 2016)
achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet classification, and won the first place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.
In this section, we perform experiments with a 110-layer
deep residual network on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
data sets. The code is based on its Torch implementation2 . We leave the architecture and related settings intact,
and use the same learning rate schedule. The default optimizer in the Torch code is NAG. Here, we also experiment
with Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam and the proposed FTML.
A minibatch size of 32 is used.
Convergence of the training cross entropy loss is shown
in Figure 2. As can been seen, all optimizers, except
Adadelta, are very competitive and have comparable per1

formance on these two data sets. NAG shows slower initial
convergence, while FTML converges slightly faster than
the others on the CIFAR-10 data set.
4.3. Memory Networks
Recently, there has been a lot of attention on combining inference, attention and memory for various machine learning tasks. In particular, the memory network (Weston et al.,
2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) has been popularly used for
natural language understanding.
In this section, we use the example model of the end-toend memory network (with LSTM) from the Keras library.
We consider the question answering task (Sukhbaatar et al.,
2015; Weston et al., 2016), and perform experiments on the
“single supporting fact” task in the bAbI data set (Weston
et al., 2016). This task consists of questions in which a
previously given single sentence provides the answer. An

example is shown below. We use a single supporting memory, and a minibatch size of 32.

Convergence of the training cross entropy loss is shown
in Figure 3. As can be seen, FTML and RMSprop perform best on this data set. Adam is slower, while NAG and
Adadelta perform poorly.
4.4. Neural Conversational Model
The neural conversational model (Vinyals & Le, 2015) is
a sequence-to-sequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014) that
is capable of predicting the next sequence given the last or
previous sequences in a conversation. A LSTM layer en-

codes the input sentence to a thought vector, and a second
LSTM layer decodes the thought vector to the response. It
has been shown that this model can often produce fluent
and natural conversations.

Sprop and FTML are comparable and yield higher scores
than Adam. On Asterix, FTML outperforms all the others. In particular, the DQN trained with RMSprop fails to
learn the task, and its score begins to drop after about 100
epochs. A similar problem has also been observed in (Hasselt et al., 2016). Experience replay (Mnih et al., 2015)
has been commonly used in deep reinforcement learning
to smooth over changes in the data distribution, and avoid
oscillations or divergence of the parameters. However, results here show that Adam still has inferior performance
because of its use of all past gradients, many of these are
not informative when the data distribution has changed.

In this experiment, we use the publicly available Torch implementation3 with a constant stepsize, and its default data
set Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus (with 50, 000 samples)
(Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil & Lee, 2011). The number of
hidden units is set to 1000, and the minibatch size is 10.
Convergence of the training cross entropy loss is shown in
Figure 4. Adadelta is not reported here, since it performs
poorly (as in previous experiments). As can be seen, FTML
outperforms Adam and RMSprop. In particular, RMSprop
is much inferior. NAG is slower than FTML and Adam in
the first 21 epochs, but becomes faster towards the end of
training.
4.5. Deep Q-Network
In this section, we use the Deep Q-network (DQN) (Mnih
et al., 2015) for deep reinforcement learning. Experiments
are performed on two computer games on the Atari 2600
platform: Breakout and Asterix. We use the publicly available Torch implementation with the default network setup4 ,
and a minibatch size of 32. We only compare FTML
with RMSprop and Adam for optimization, as NAG and
Adadelta are rarely used in training the DQN. As in (Mnih
et al., 2015), we use  = 10−2 for all methods, and performance evaluation is based on the average score per episode.
The higher the score, the better the performance.
Convergence is shown in Figure 5. On Breakout, RM3

4.6. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
To illustrate the problem of Adam in Section 4.5 more
clearly, we perform the following timeseries prediction experiment with the LSTM. We construct a synthetic timeseries of length 1000. This is divided into 20 segments,
each of length 50. At each time point, the sample is 10dimensional. In segment i, samples are generated from a
normal distribution with mean ([i, i, . . . , i] + ζi ) ∈ R10
and identity covariance matrix, where the components of ζi
are independent standard normal random variables. Noise
from the standard normal distribution is added to corrupt
the data. The task is to predict the data sample at the next
time point t.
We use a one-layer LSTM implemented in (Léonard et al.,
2015). 100 hidden units are used. We truncate backpropagation through time (BPTT) to 5 timesteps, and input
5 samples to the LSTM in each iteration. Thus, the data distribution changes every 10 iterations, as a different normal
distribution is then used for data generation. Performance
evaluation is based on the squared loss ft (θt−1 ) at time t.
Convergence of the loss is shown in Figure 6(a). As can be

seen, Adam has difficulty in adapting to the data. In contrast, FTML and RMSprop can adapt more quickly, yielding better and more stable performance.
As a baseline, we consider the case where the data distribution does not change (the means of all the segments are
fixed to the vector of ones) Figure 6(b) shows the results.
As can be seen, Adam now performs comparably to FTML
and RMSprop.
4.7. Summary of Results
The main problem with RMSprop is that its performance
is not stable. Sometimes, it performs well, but sometimes
it can have significantly inferior performance (e.g., as can
be seen from Figures 1, 4 and 5(b)). The performance of
Adam is more stable, though it often lags behind the best
optimizer (e.g., Figures 1(b), 3, and 4). It is particularly
problematic when learning in a changing environment (Fig-

ures 5 and 6(a)). In contrast, the proposed FTML shows
stable performance on various models and tasks. It converges quickly, and is always the best (or at least among
the best) in all our experiments.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a FTPRL variant called FTML,
in which the recent samples are weighted more heavily in
each iteration. Hence, it is able to adapt more quickly when
the parameter moves to another local basin, or when the
data distribution changes. FTML is closely related to RMSprop and Adam. In particular, it enjoys their nice properties, but avoids their pitfalls. Experimental results on a
number of deep learning models and tasks demonstrate that
FTML converges quickly, and is always the best (or among
the best) of the various optimizers.
