Discovering Discrete Latent Topics with Neural Variational Inference

Abstract
Topic models have been widely explored as probabilistic generative models of documents. Traditional inference methods have sought closedform derivations for updating the models, however as the expressiveness of these models grows,
so does the difficulty of performing fast and
accurate inference over their parameters. This
paper presents alternative neural approaches to
topic modelling by providing parameterisable
distributions over topics which permit training
by backpropagation in the framework of neural variational inference. In addition, with the
help of a stick-breaking construction, we propose a recurrent network that is able to discover a notionally unbounded number of topics, analogous to Bayesian non-parametric topic
models. Experimental results on the MXM
Song Lyrics, 20NewsGroups and Reuters News
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these neural topic models.

1. Introduction
Probabilistic models for inducing latent topics from documents are one of the great success stories of unsupervised
learning. Starting with latent semantic analysis (LSA (Landauer et al., 1998)), models for uncovering the underlying semantic structure of a document collection have been
widely applied in data mining, text processing and information retrieval. Probabilistic topic models (e.g. PLSA (Hofmann, 1999), LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and HDPs (Teh et al.,
2006)) provide a robust, scalable, and theoretically sound
foundation for document modelling by introducing latent
variables for each token to topic assignment.
For the traditional Dirichlet-Multinomial topic model, efficient inference is available by exploiting conjugacy with

either Monte Carlo or Variational techniques (Jordan et al.,
1999; Attias, 2000; Beal, 2003)). However, as topic models have grown more expressive, in order to capture topic
dependencies or exploit conditional information, inference
methods have become increasingly complex. This is especially apparent for non-conjugate models (Carlin & Polson,
1991; Blei & Lafferty, 2007; Wang & Blei, 2013).
Deep neural networks are excellent function approximators
and have shown great potential for learning complicated
non-linear distributions for unsupervised models. Neural
variational inference (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende
et al., 2014; Mnih & Gregor, 2014) approximates the posterior of a generative model with a variational distribution
parameterised by a neural network. This allows both the
generative model and the variational network to be jointly
trained with backpropagation. For models with continuous latent variables associated with particular distributions,
such as Gaussians, there exist reparameterisations (Kingma
& Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) of the distribution
permitting unbiased and low-variance estimates of the gradients with respect to the parameters of the inference network. For models with discrete latent variables, MonteCarlo estimates of the gradient must be employed. Recently, algorithms such as REINFORCE have been used effectively to decrease variance and improve learning (Mnih
& Gregor, 2014; Mnih et al., 2014).
In this work we propose and evaluate a range of topic models parameterised with neural networks and trained with
variational inference. We introduce three different neural
structures for constructing topic distributions: the Gaussian
Softmax distribution (GSM), the Gaussian Stick Breaking
distribution (GSB), and the Recurrent Stick Breaking process (RSB), all of which are conditioned on a draw from
a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian Softmax topic model constructs a finite topic distribution with a
softmax function applied to the projection of the Gaussian
random vector. The Gaussian Stick Breaking model also
constructs a discrete distribution from the Gaussian draw,
but this time employing a stick breaking construction to
provide a bias towards sparse topic distributions. Finally,
the Recurrent Stick Breaking process employs a recurrent
neural network, again conditioned on the Gaussian draw, to
progressively break the stick, yielding a neural analog of a
Dirichlet Process topic model (Teh et al., 2006).

Discovering Discrete Latent Topics with Neural Variational Inference

Our neural topic models combine the merits of both neural
networks and traditional probabilistic topic models. They
can be trained efficiently by backpropagation, scaled to
large data sets, and easily conditioned on any available
contextual information. Further, as probabilistic graphical models, they are interpretable and explicitly represent
the dependencies amongst the random variables. Previous neural document models, such as the neural variational document model (NVDM) (Miao et al., 2016), belief
networks document model (Mnih & Gregor, 2014), neural auto-regressive document model (Larochelle & Lauly,
2012) and replicated softmax (Hinton & Salakhutdinov,
2009), have not explicitly modelled latent topics. Through
evaluations on a range of data sets we compare our models with previously proposed neural document models and
traditional probabilistic topic models, demonstrating their
robustness and effectiveness.

2. Parameterising Topic Distributions
In probabilistic topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al.,
2003), we use the latent variables θd and zn for the topic
proportion of document d, and the topic assignment for
the observed word wn , respectively. In order to facilitate
efficient inference, the Dirichlet distribution (or Dirichlet
process (Teh et al., 2006)) is employed as the prior to generate the parameters of the multinomial distribution θd for
each document. The use of a conjugate prior allows the
tractable computation of the posterior distribution over the
latent variables’ values. While alternatives have been explored, such as log-normal topic distributions (Blei & Lafferty, 2006; 2007), extra approximation (e.g. the Laplace
approximation (Wang & Blei, 2013)) is required for closed
form derivations. The generative process of LDA is:
θd ∼ Dir(α0 ),
zn ∼ Multi(θd ),

for d ∈ D
for n ∈ [1, Nd ]

wn ∼ Multi(βzn ), for n ∈ [1, Nd ]
where βzn represents the topic distribution over words
given topic assignment zn and Nd is the number of tokens
in document d. βzn can be drawn from another Dirichlet
distribution, but here we consider it a model parameter. α0
is the hyper-parameter of the Dirichlet prior and Nd is the
total number of words in document d. The marginal likelihood for a document in collection D is:
Z
YX
p(d|α0 , β)= p(θ|α0 )
p(wn |βzn )p(zn |θ)dθ. (1)
θ

n zn

If we employ mean-field variational inference, the updates
for the variational parameters q(θ) and q(zn ) can be directly derived in closed form.
In contrast, our proposed models introduce a neural network to parameterise the multinomial topic distribution.

The generative process is:
θd ∼ G(µ0 , σ02 ),

for d ∈ D

zn ∼ Multi(θd ),

for n ∈ [1, Nd ]

wn ∼ Multi(βzn ), for n ∈ [1, Nd ]
where G(µ0 , σ02 ) is composed of a neural network θ =
g(x) conditioned on a isotropic Gaussian x ∼ N (µ0 , σ02 )1 .
The marginal likelihood is:
Z
p(d|µ0 , σ0 , β) =
p(θ|µ0 , σ02 )
(2)
θ
Y X
p(wn |βzn )p(zn |θ)dθ.

zn

Compared to Equation (1), here we parameterise the latent variable θ by a neural network conditioned on a draw
from a Gaussian distribution. To carry out neural variational inference (Miao et al., 2016), we construct an inference network q(θ|µ(d), σ(d)) to approximate the posterior p(θ|d), where µ(d) and σ(d) are functions of d that
are implemented by multilayer perceptrons (MLP). By using a Gaussian prior distribution, we are able to employ
the re-parameterisation trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014) to
build an unbiased and low-variance gradient estimator for
the variational distribution. Without conjugacy, the updates
of the parameters can still be derived directly and easily
from the variational lower bound. We defer discussion of
the inference process until the next section. Here we introduce several alternative neural networks for g(x) which
transform a Gaussian sample x into the topic proportions θ.
2.1. The Gaussian Softmax Construction
In deep learning, an energy-based function is generally
used to construct probability distributions (LeCun et al.,
2006). Here we pass a Gaussian random vector through
a softmax function to parameterise the multinomial document topic distributions. Thus θ ∼ GGSM (µ0 , σ02 ) is defined as:
x ∼ N (µ0 , σ02 )
θ = softmax(W1T x)
where W1 is a linear transformation, and we leave out the
bias terms for brevity. µ0 and σ02 are hyper-parameters
which we set for a zero mean and unit variance Gaussian.
2.2. The Gaussian Stick Breaking Construction
In Bayesian non-parametrics, the stick breaking process
(Sethuraman, 1994) is used as a constructive definition
of the Dirichlet process, where sequentially drawn Beta

Throughout this presentation we employ isotropic Gaussian
distributions. As such we use N (µ, σ 2 ) to represent the Gaussian
distributions, where σ 2 is the diagonal of the covariance matrix.

random variables define breaks from a unit stick. In our
case, following Khan et al. (2012), we transform the modelling of multinomial probability parameters into the modelling of the logits of binomial probability parameters using
Gaussian latent variables. More specifically, conditioned
on a Gaussian sample x ∈ RH , the breaking proportions
η ∈ RK−1 are generated by applying the sigmoid function η = sigmoid(W2T x) where W ∈ RH×K−1 . Starting
with the first piece of the stick, the probability of the first
category is modelled as a break of proportion η1 , while the
length of the remainder of the stick is left for the next break.
Thus each dimension can be deterministically computed by
Qk−1
θk = ηk i=1 (1 − ηi ) until k = K−1, and the remaining length
is taken as the probability of the Kth category
QK−1
θK = i=1 (1 − ηi ).
For instance assume K = 3, θ is generated by 2 breaks
where θ1 = η1 , θ2 = η2 (1 − η1 ) and the remaining stick
θ3 = (1 − η2 )(1 − η1 ). If the model proceeds to break
the stick for K = 4, the remaining stick θ3 is broken into
(θ30 , θ40 ), where θ30 = η3 · θ3 , θ40 = (1 − η3 ) · θ3 and
θ3 = θ30 + θ40 . Hence, for different values of K, it alPK
ways satisfies k=1 θk = 1. The stick breaking construction fSB (η) is illustrated in Figure 1 and the distribution
θ ∼ GGSB (µ0 , σ02 ) is defined as:
x ∼

N (µ0 , σ02 )

fSB (η)

Although the Gaussian stick breaking construction breaks
exchangeability, compared to the stick breaking definition of the Dirichlet process, it does provide a more
amenable form for neural variational inference. More interestingly, this stick breaking construction introduces a nonparametric aspect to neural topic models.
2.3. The Recurrent Stick Breaking Construction
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are commonly used for
modelling sequences of inputs in deep learning. Here we
consider the stick breaking construction as a sequential

draw from an RNN, thus capturing an unbounded number
of breaks with a finite number of parameters. Conditioned
on a Gaussian latent variable x, the recurrent neural network fSB (x) produces a sequence of binomial logits which
are used to break the stick sequentially. The fRNN (x) is
decomposed as:
hk

= RNNSB (hk−1 )

ηk

= sigmoid(hTk−1 x)

where hk is the output of the kth state, which we feed into
the next state of the RNNSB as an input. Figure 2 shows the
recurrent neural network structure. Now θ ∼ GRSB (µ0 , σ02 )
is defined as:
x ∼

N (µ0 , σ02 )

η

=

fRNN (x)

θ

=

fSB (η)

where fSB (η) is equivalent to the stick breaking function
used in the Gaussian stick breaking construction. Here, the
RNN is able to dynamically produce new logits to break
the stick ad infinitum. The expressive power of the RNN to
model sequences of unbounded length is still bounded by
the parametric model’s capacity, but for topic modelling it
is adequate to model the countably infinite topics amongst
the documents in a truncation-free fashion.

3. Models
Given the above described constructions for the topic distributions, in this section we introduce our family of neural
topic models and corresponding inference methods.
3.1. Neural Topic Models
Assume we have finite number of topics K, the topic
distribution over words given a topic assignment zn is
p(wn |β, zn ) = Multi(βzn ). Here we introduce topic vectors t ∈ RK×H , word vectors v ∈ RV ×H and generate the
topic distributions over words by:
βk = softmax(v · tTk ).

of the generative model p(d | θ).

Therefore, β ∈ RK×V is a collection of simplexes achieved
by computing the semantic similarity between topics and
words. Following the notation introduced in Section 2,
the prior distribution is defined as G(θ|µ0 , σ02 ) in which
x ∼ N (x|µ0 , σ02 ) and the projection network generates
θ = g(x) for each document. Here, g(x) can be the Gaussian Softmax gGSM (x), Gaussian Stick Breaking gGSB (x),
or Recurrent Stick Breaking gRSB (x) constructions with
fixed length RNNSB . We derive a variational lower bound
for the document log-likelihood according to Equation (2):

log
[p(wn |βzn )p(zn |θ)]
n=1
zn


−DKL q(θ|d)||p(θ|µ0 , σ02 )
(3)
where q(θ|d) is the variational distribution approximating
the true posterior p(θ|d). Following the framework of neural variational inference (Miao et al., 2016; Kingma &
Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014), we introduce an inference network conditioned on the observed document d
to generate the variational parameters µ(d) and σ(d) so
that we can estimate the lower bound by sampling θ from
q(θ|d) = G(θ|µ(d), σ 2 (d)). In practise we reparameterise
θ̂ = µ(d) + ˆ · σ(d) with the sample ˆ ∈ N (0, I).
Since the generative distribution p(θ|µ0 , σ02 )
=
p(g(x)|µ0 , σ02 ) = p(x|µ0 , σ02 ) and the variational
distribution q(θ|d) = q(g(x)|d) = q(x|µ(d), σ 2 (d)), the
KL term in Equation (3) can be easily integrated as a
Gaussian KL-divergence. Note that, the parameterisation
network g(x) and its parameters are shared across all the
documents. In addition, given a sampled θ̂, the latent
variable zn can be integrated out as:
i
X h
log p(wn |β, θ̂) = log
p(wn |βzn )p(zn |θ̂)
zn

log(θ̂ · β)

Thus there is no need to introduce another variational ap-

proximation for the topic assignment z. The variational
lower bound is therefore:
i
XN h
log p(wn |β, θ̂) − DKL [q(x|d)||p(x)]
Ld ≈ L̂d =
n=1

We can directly derive the gradients of the generative parameters Θ, including t, v and g(x). While for the variational parameters Φ, including µ(d) and σ(d), we use the
gradient estimators:
∇µ(d) L̂d

≈

∇θ̂ L̂d ,

∇σ(d) L̂d

≈

ˆ · ∇θ̂ L̂d .

Θ and Φ are jointly updated by stochastic gradient backpropagation. The structure of this variational auto-encoder
is illustrated in Figure 3.
3.2. Recurrent Neural Topic Models
For the GSM and GSB models the topic vectors t ∈ RK×H
have to be predefined for computing the topic distribution
over words β. With the RSB construction we can model
an unbounded number of topics, however in addition to the
RNNSB that generates the topic proportions θ ∈ R∞ for
each document, we must introduce another neural network
RNNTopic to produce the topics t ∈ R∞×H dynamically, so
as to avoid the need to truncate the variational inference.
For comparison, in finite neural topic models we have topic
vectors t ∈ RK×H , while in unbounded neural topic models the topics t ∈ R∞×H are dynamically generated by
RNNTopic and the order of the topics corresponds to the order of the states in RNNSB . The generation of β follows:
tk

= RNNTopic (tk−1 ),

βk

= softmax(v · tTk ),

where v ∈ RV ×H represents the word vectors, tk is the
kth topic generated by RNNTopic and k < ∞. Figure 4
illustrates the neural structure of RNNTopic .
For the unbounded topic models we introduce a truncationfree neural variational inference method which enables the

Discovering Discrete Latent Topics with Neural Variational Inference

model to dynamically decide the number of active topics.
Assume the current active number of topics is i, RNNTopic
generates ti ∈ Ri×H by an i−1 step stick-breaking process
(the logit for the nth topic is the remaining stick after i − 1
breaks). The variational lower bound for a document d is:
i
XN h
Lid ≈
log p(wn |β i , θ̂i ) − DKL [q(x|d)||p(x)] ,
n=1

where θ̂i corresponds to the topic distribution over words
β t . In order to dynamically increase the number of topics,
the model proposes the ith break on the stick to split the
(i + 1)th topic. In this case, RNNTopic proceeds to the next
state and generates topic t(i+1) for β (i+1) and the RNNSB
generates θ̂(i+1) by an extra break of the stick. Firstly, we
compute the likelihood increase brought by topic i across
the documents D:
XD 
 XD i
I=
Lid − Li−1
/
[Ld ]
d

d

Then, we employ an acceptance hyper-parameter γ to decide whether to generate a new topic. If I > γ, the previous
proposed new topic (the ith topic) contributes to the generation of words and we increase the active number of topics
i by 1, otherwise we keep the current i unchanged. Thus γ
controls the rate at which the model generates new topics.
In practise, the increase of the lower bound is computed
over mini-batches so that the model is able to generate new
topics before the current epoch is finished. The details of
the algorithm are described in Algorithm 1.
3.3. Topic vs. Document Models
In most topic models documents are modelled by a mixture of topics, and each word is associated with a single
topic latent variable. Miao et al. (2016) proposed a neural variational document model (NVDM) implemented as a
variational auto-encoder (Kingma & Welling, 2014), which
has a very similar neural structure to our models. The major difference is that NVDM employs a softmax decoder
(Equation (5)) to generate all of the words of a document
conditioned on an unnormalised vector:
log p(wn |β, θ̂) = log softmax(θ̂ · β).

(5)

In the GSM construction, if we replace the generative distribution (Equation 4) with the above distribution (Equation
5) and remove the softmax function over θ, it reduces to a
variant of the NVDM model (GSM applies topic and word
vectors to compute β, while NVDM directly models β).
Srivastava & Sutton (2016) interpret the above decoder as a
weighted product of experts topic model, but do not model
the topics explicitly. Here we refer to such models that do
not directly assign topics to words as document models. We
can also convert our constructions to document models by
employing the softmax decoder. We include these models
in the experimental evaluation section.

4. Related Work
Topic models have been extensively studied for a variety of applications in document modelling and information retrieval. Beyond LDA, significant extensions
have sought to capture topic correlations (Blei & Lafferty, 2007), model temporal dependencies (Blei & Lafferty, 2006) and discover an unbounded number of topics
(Teh et al., 2006). Topic models have been extended to
capture extra context information such as time (Wang &
McCallum, 2006), authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), and
class labels (McAuliffe & Blei, 2008). Such extensions often require carefully tailored graphical models, and associated inference algorithms, to capture the desired context.
Neural models provide a more generic and extendable option and a number of works have sought to leverage these,
such as the Replicated Softmax (Hinton & Salakhutdinov,
2009), the Auto-Regressive Document Model (Larochelle
& Lauly, 2012), Sigmoid Belief Document Model (Mnih &
Gregor, 2014), Variational Auto-Encoder Document Model
(NVDM) (Miao et al., 2016) and TopicRNN Model (Dieng
et al., 2016). However, these neural works do not explicitly
capture topic assignments.
The recent work of Srivastava & Sutton (2016) also employs neural variational inference to train topic models and
is closely related to our work. Their model follows the original LDA formulation in keeping the Dirichlet-Multinomial
parameterisation and applies a Laplace approximation to
allow gradient to back-propagate to the variational distribution. In contrast, our models directly parameterise the
multinomial distribution with neural networks and jointly
learn the model and variational parameters during inference. Nalisnick & Smyth (2016) proposes a reparameter-

RCV1-v24 news. MXM is the official lyrics collection of
the Million Song Dataset with 210,519 training and 27,143
testing datapoints respectively. The 20NewsGroups corpus is divided into 11,314 training and 7,531 testing documents, while the RCV1-v2 corpus is a larger collection
with 794,414 training and 10,000 test cases from Reuters
newswire stories. We employ the original 5,000 vocabulary provided for MXM, while the other two datasets are
processed by stemming, filtering stopwords and taking the
most frequent 2,0005 and 10,000 words as the vocabularies.

The hidden dimension of the MLP for constructing q(θ|d)
is 256 for all the neural topic models and the benchmarks
that apply neural variational inference (e.g. NVDM, proLDA, NVLDA), and 0.8 dropout is applied on the output
of the MLP before parameterising the isotropic Gaussian
distribution. Grid search is carried out on learning rate and
batch size for achieving the held-out perplexity. For the
recurrent stick breaking construction we use a one layer
LSTM cell (256 hidden units) for constructing the recurrent
neural network. For the finite topic models we set the maximum number of topics K as 50 and 200. The models are
trained by Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) and only one sample is used for neural variational inference. We follow the
optimisation strategy of Miao et al. (2016) by alternately
updating the model parameters and the inference network.
To alleviate the redundant topics issue, we also apply topic
diversity regularisation (Xie et al., 2015) while carrying out
neural variational inference. The details can be found in the

To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the stickbreaking construction, Figure 5 presents the average probability of each topic by estimating the posterior probability
q(z|d) of each document from 20NewsGroups. Here we set
the number of topics to 400, which is large enough for this
dataset. Figure 5a shows that the topics with higher probability are evenly distributed. While in Figure 5a the higher
probability ones are placed in the front, and we can see a
small tail on the topics after 300. Due to the sparsity inducing property of the stick-breaking construction, the topics
on the tail are less likely to be sampled. This is also the advantage of stick-breaking construction when we apply the
RSB-TF as a non-parameteric topic model, since the model
activates the topics according to the knowledge learned
from data and it becomes less sensitive to the hyperparameter controlling the initial number of topics. Figure 6 shows
the impact on test perplexity for the neural topic models
when the maximum number of topics is increased. We can
see that the performance of the GSM model gets worse if
the maximum number of topics exceeds 400, but the GSB
and RSB are stable even though the number of topics far
outstrips that which the model requires. In addition, the

Next we evaluate our neural network parameterisations as
document models with the implicit topic distribution introduced in Section 3.3. Table 2 compares the proposed neural document models with the benchmarks. According to
our experimental results, the generalisation abilities of the
GSM, GSB and RSB models are all improved by switching
to an implicit topic distribution, and their performance is
also significantly better than the NVDM and ProdLDA. We
hypothesise that this effect is due to the models not needing
to infer the topic-word assignments, which makes optimisation much easier. Interestingly, the RSB model performs
better than the GSM and GSB on 20NewsGroups in both
the 50 and 200 topic settings. This is possibly due to the
fact that GSM and GSB apply linear transformations W1
and W2 to generate the hidden variable θ and breaking proportions η from a Gaussian draw, while the RSB applies recurrent neural networks to produce η in a sequence which
induces dependencies in η and helps escape local minima.
It is worth noting that the recurrent neural network uses
more parameters than the other two models. As mentioned
in Section 3.3, GSM is a variant of NVDM that applies
topic and word vectors to construct the topic distribution
over words instead of directly modelling a multinomial distribution by a softmax function, which further simplifies
optimisation. If it is not necessary to model the explicit
topic distribution over words, using an implicit topic distribution may lead to better generalisation.

RSB model performs better than GSB when the number
of topics is under 200, but it becomes slightly worse than
GSB when the number exceeds 400, possibly due to the
difficulty of learning long sequences with RNNs.
Figure 7 shows the convergence process of the truncationfree RSB (RSB-TF) model on the 20NewsGroups. With
different initial number of topics, 10, 30, and 50. The RSBTF dynamically increases the number of active topics to
achieve a better variational lower bound. We can see the
training perplexity keeps decreasing while the RSB-TF activates more topics. The numbers of active topics will stabilise when the convergence point is approaching (normally
between 200 and 300 active topics on the 20NewsGroups).
Hence, as a non-parametric model, RSB-TF is not sensitive
to the initial number of active topics.
In addition since the quality of the discovered topics is
not directly reflected by perplexity (i.e. a function of loglikelihood), we evaluate the topic observed coherence by
normalised point-wise mutual information (NPMI) (Lau
et al., 2014). Table 3 shows the topic observed coherence
achieved by the finite neural topic models. According to
these results, there does not appear to be a significant difference in topic coherence amongst the neural topic models. We observe that in both the GSB and RSB, the NPMI
scores of the former topics in the stick breaking order are

higher than the latter ones. It is plausible as the stickbreaking construction implicitly assumes the order of the
topics, the former topics obtain more sufficient gradients to
update the topic distributions. Likewise we present the results obtained by the neural document models with implicit
topic distributions. Though the topic probability distribution over words does not exist, we could rank the words by
the positiveness of the connections between the words and
each dimension of the latent variable. Interestingly the performance of these document models are significantly better than their topic model counterparts on topic coherence.
The results of RSB-TF and HDP are not presented due to
the fact that the number of active topics is dynamic, which
makes these two models not directly comparable to the others. To further demonstrate the quality of the topics, we
produce a t-SNE projection for the estimated topic proportions of each document in Figure 8.

The best scores we obtained are 0.222 and 0.175 for 50 and

6. Conclusion
In this paper we have introduced a family of neural
topic models using the Gaussian Softmax, Gaussian StickBreaking and Recurrent Stick-Breaking constructions for
parameterising the latent multinomial topic distributions of
each document. With the help of the stick-breaking construction, we are able to build neural topic models which
exhibit similar sparse topic distributions as found with traditional Dirichlet-Multinomial models. By exploiting the
ability of recurrent neural networks to model sequences
of unbounded length, we further present a truncation-free
variational inference method that allows the number of topics to dynamically increase. The evaluation results show
that our neural models achieve state-of-the-art performance
on a range of standard document corpora.
