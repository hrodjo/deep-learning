Variants of RMSProp and Adagrad with Logarithmic Regret Bounds

Abstract
Adaptive gradient methods have become recently
very popular, in particular as they have been
shown to be useful in the training of deep neural networks. In this paper we have analyzed
RMSProp, originally proposed for the training
of deep neural networks, in the context
of on√
line convex optimization and show T -type regret bounds. Moreover, we propose two variants SC-Adagrad and SC-RMSProp for which
we show logarithmic regret bounds for strongly
convex functions. Finally, we demonstrate in the
experiments that these new variants outperform
other adaptive gradient techniques or stochastic
gradient descent in the optimization of strongly
convex functions as well as in training of deep
neural networks.

1. Introduction
There has recently been a lot of work on adaptive gradient
algorithms such as Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011), RMSProp
(Hinton et al., 2012), ADADELTA (Zeiler, 2012), and
Adam (Kingma & Bai, 2015). The original idea of Adagrad to have a parameter specific learning rate by analyzing the gradients observed during the optimization turned
out to be useful not only in online convex optimization
but also for training deep neural networks. The original
analysis of Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) was limited to the
case of all convex functions for which
√ it obtained a datadependent regret bound of order O( T ) which is known
to be optimal (Hazan, 2016) for this class. However, a lot
of learning problems have more structure in the sense that
one optimizes over the restricted class of strongly convex
functions. It has been shown in (Hazan et al., 2007) that
one can achieve much better logarithmic regret bounds for
the class of strongly convex functions.

The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we propose SCAdagrad which is a variant of Adagrad adapted to the
strongly convex case. We show that SC-Adagrad achieves
a logarithmic regret bound for the case of strongly convex
functions, which is data-dependent. It is known that such
bounds can be much better in practice than data independent bounds (Hazan et al., 2007),(McMahan, 2014). Second, we analyze RMSProp which has become one of the
standard methods to train neural networks beyond stochastic gradient descent. We show that under some conditions on the weighting scheme√of RMSProp, this algorithm
achieves a data-dependent O( T ) regret bound. In fact, it
turns out that RMSProp contains Adagrad as a special case
for a particular choice of the weighting scheme. Up to our
knowledge this is the first theoretical result justifying the
usage of RMSProp in online convex optimization and thus
can at least be seen as theoretical support for its usage in
deep learning. Similarly, we then propose the variant SCRMSProp for which we also show a data-dependent logarithmic regret bound similar to SC-Adagrad for the class of
strongly convex functions. Interestingly, SC-Adagrad has
been discussed in (Ruder, 2016), where it is said that “it
does not to work”. The reason for this is that SC-Adagrad
comes along with a damping factor which prevents potentially large steps in the beginning of the iterations. However, as our analysis shows this damping factor has to be
rather large initially to prevent large steps and should be
then monotonically decreasing as a function of the iterations in order to stay adaptive. Finally, we show in experiments on three datasets that the new methods are competitive or outperform other adaptive gradient techniques as
well as stochastic gradient descent for strongly convex optimization problem in terms of regret and training objective
but also perform very well in the training of deep neural
networks, where we show results for different networks and
datasets.

We first need some technical statements and notation and
then introduce the online convex optimization problem.

Variants of RMSProp and Adagrad with Logarithmic Regret Bounds

2.1. Notation and Technical Statements
We denote by [T ] the set {1, . . . , T }. Let A ∈ Rd×d be a
symmetric, positive definite matrix. We denote as
d
X

hx, yiA = hx, Ayi =

Aij xi yj ,

kxkA

q
= hx, xiA

i,j=1

Note that P
the standard Euclidean inner product becomes
hx, yi =
i xi yi = hx, yiI While we use here the general notation for matrices for comparison to the literature.
All positive definite matrices A in this paper will be diagonal matrices, so that the computational effort for computing
inner products and norms is still linear in d. The CauchySchwarz inequality becomes, hx, yiA ≤ kxkA kykA . We
further introduce the element-wise product ab of two vectors. Let a, b ∈ Rd , then (a  b)i = ai bi for i = 1, . . . , d.
Let A ∈ Rd×d be a symmetric, positive definite matrix,
z ∈ Rd and C ⊂ Rd a convex set. Then we define the
weighted projection PCA (z) of z onto the set C as
2

PCA (z) = arg min kx − zkA .

(1)

We assume that the adversarial can choose from the class
of convex functions on C, for some parts we will specialize
this to the set of strongly convex functions.
Definition 2.1 Let C be a convex set. We say that a function f : C → R is µ-strongly convex, if there exists µ ∈ Rd
with µi > 0 for i = 1, . . . , d such that for all x, y ∈ C,
2

f (y) ≥ f (x) + h∇f (x), y − xi + ky − xkdiag(µ)
= f (x) + h∇f (x), y − xi +

d
X

µi (yi − xi )2 .

i=1

Let ζ = mini=1,...,d µi , then this function is ζ-strongly convex (in the usual sense), that is
2

f (y) ≥ f (x) + h∇f (x), y − xi + ζ kx − yk .
Note that the difference between our notion of componentwise strong convexity and the usual definition of strong
convexity is indicated by the bold font versus normal font.
We have two assumptions:

x∈C

It is well-known that the weighted projection is unique and
non-expansive.

• A1: It holds supt≥1 kgt k2 ≤ G which implies the
existence of a constant G∞ such that supt≥1 kgt k∞ ≤
G∞ .

Lemma 2.1 Let A ∈ Rd×d be a symmetric, positive definite matrix and C ⊂ Rd be a convex set. Then

 A
PC (z) − PCA (y) ≤ kz − yk .
A
A

• A2: It holds supt≥1 kθt − θ∗ k2 ≤ D which implies the existence of a constant D∞ such that
supt≥1 kθt − θ∗ k∞ ≤ D∞ .

Lemma 2.2 For any symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix A ∈ Rd×d we have
hx, Axi ≤ λmax (A) hx, xi ≤ tr(A) hx, xi

(2)

where λmax (A) is the maximum eigenvalue of matrix A
and tr(A) denotes the trace of matrix A .
2.2. Problem Statement
In this paper we analyze the online convex optimization
setting, that is we have a convex set C and at each round we
get access to a (sub)-gradient of some continuous convex
function ft : C → R. At the t-th iterate we predict θt ∈ C
and suffer a loss ft (θt ). The goal is to perform well with
respect to the optimal decision in hindsight defined as
∗

θ = arg min
θ∈C

T
X

ft (θ).

t=1

The adversarial regret at time T ∈ N is then given as
R(T ) =

T
X
t=1

(ft (θt ) − ft (θ∗ )).

One of the first
√ methods which achieves the optimal regret
bound of O( T ) for convex problems is online projected
gradient descent (Zinkevich, 2003), defined as
θt+1 = PC (θt − αt gt )

(3)

where αt = √αt is the step-size scheme and gt is a (sub)gradient of ft at θt . With αt = αt , online projected gradient descent method achieves the optimal O(log(T )) regret
bound for strongly-convex problems (Hazan et al., 2007).
We consider Adagrad in the next subsection which is one of
the popular adaptive alternative to online projected gradient
descent.
2.3. Adagrad for convex problems
In this section we briefly recall the main result for the Adagrad. The algorithm for Adagrad is given in Algorithm 1. If
the adversarial is allowed to choose from the set of all possible convex functions on C √
⊂ Rd , then Adagrad achieves
the regret bound of order O( T ) as shown in (Duchi et al.,
2011). This regret bound is known to be optimal for this
class, see e.g. (Hazan, 2016). For better comparison to
our results for RMSProp, we recall the result from (Duchi

Theorem 2.1 (Duchi et al., 2011) Let Assumptions A1, A2
hold and let θt be the sequence generated by Adagrad in
Algorithm 1, where gt ∈ ∂ft (θt ) and ft : C → R is an
arbitrary convex function, then for stepsize α > 0 the regret
is upper bounded as

the notation, g1:T,i = (g1,i , g2,i , .., gT,i )T , where gt,i is the
i-th component of the gradient gt ∈ Rd of the function ft

Thus an alternative point of view of Adagrad, is that it has a
decaying stepsize √αt but now the correction term becomes
the running average of the squared derivatives plus a vanishing damping term. However, the effective stepsize has
to decay faster to get a logarithmic regret bound for the
strongly convex case. This is what we analyze in the next
section, where we propose SC-Adagrad for strongly convex
functions.

3. Strongly convex Adagrad (SC-Adagrad)
The modification SC-Adagrad of Adagrad which we propose in the following can be motivated by the observation
that the online projected gradient descent (Hazan et al.,
2007) uses stepsizes of order α = O( T1 ) in order to achieve
the logarithmic regret bound for strongly convex functions.
In analogy with the
in the previous section, we
Pderivation
T
2
still have vT,i = t=1 gt,i
. But now we modify (At )−1

Again, we have in the denominator a running average of
the observed gradients and a decaying damping factor. In
this way, we get an effective stepsize of order O( T1 ) in SCAdagrad. The formal method is presented in Algorithm
2. As just derived the only difference of Adagrad and SCAdagrad is the definition of the diagonal matrix At . Note
Algorithm 2 SC-Adagrad
Input: θ1 ∈ C , δ0 > 0, v0 = 0 ∈ Rd

At = diag(vt ) + diag(δt ) 
θt+1 = PCAt θt − αA−1

end for
also that we have defined the damping factor δt as a function of t which is also different from standard Adagrad.
The constant δ in Adagrad is mainly introduced due to numerical reasons in order to avoid problems when gt,i is
very small for some components in the first iterations and
is typically chosen quite small e.g. δ = 10−8 . For SCAdagrad the situation is different. If the first components
g1,i , g2,i , . . . are very small, say of order , then the update

is 2 +δ
which can become extremely large if δt is chosen
t
to be small. This would make the method very unstable
and would lead to huge constants in the bounds. This is
probably why in (Ruder, 2016), the modification of Adagrad where one “drops the square-root” did not work. A
good choice of δt should be initially
on the order

of 1 and it should decay as vt,i = t=1 gt,i
This is why we propose to use
δt,i = ξ2 e−ξ1 vt,i ,

i = 1, . . . , d,

for ξ1 > 0, ξ2 > 0 as a potential decay scheme as it satisfies both properties for sufficiently large ξ1 and ξ2 chosen
on the order of 1. Also, one can achieve a constant decay scheme for ξ1 = 0 , ξ2 > 0. We will come back to
this choice after the proof. In the following we provide the
regret analysis of SC-Adagrad and show that the optimal
logarithmic regret bound can be achieved. However, as it is
data-dependent it is typically significantly better in practice
than data-independent bounds.

3.1. Analysis
For any two matrices A, B ∈ Rd×d , we use
P the
P notation
• to denote the inner product i.e A • B = i j Aij Bij .
Note that A • B = tr(AT B).
Lemma 3.1 [Lemma 12 (Hazan et al., 2007)] Let A, B be
positive definite matrices, let A  B  0 then

Theorem 3.1 Let Assumptions A1, A2 hold and let θt be
the sequence generated by the SC-Adagrad in Algorithm
2, where gt ∈ ∂ft (θt ) and ft : C → R is an arbitrary
µ-strongly convex function (µ ∈ Rd+ ) where the stepsize

fulfills α ≥ maxi=1,...,d 2µ∞i . Furthermore, let δt > 0 and
δt,i ≤ δt−1,i ∀t ∈ [T ], ∀i ∈ [d], then the regret of SCAdagrad can be upper bounded for T ≥ 1 as

The bound includes also the case of a non-decaying damping factor δt = δ = ξ2 (ξ1 = 0). While a rather large
constant damping factor can work well, we have noticed
that the best results are obtained with the decay scheme
δt,i = ξ2 e−ξ1 vt,i ,

i = 1, . . . , d.

where ξ1 > 0 , ξ2 > 0 , which is what we use in the experiments. Note that this decay scheme for ξ1 , ξ2 > 0 is
adaptive to the specific dimension and thus increases the
adaptivity of the overall algorithm. For completeness we
also give the bound specialized for this decay scheme.
Corollary 3.1 In the setting of Theorem 3.1 choose δt,i =
ξ2 e−ξ1 vt,i for i = 1, . . . , d for some ξ1 > 0, ξ2 > 0 . Then
the regret of SC-Adagrad can be upper bounded for T ≥ 1

Unfortunately, it is not obvious that the regret bound for our
decaying damping factor is better than the one of a constant
damping factor. Note, however that the third term in the regret bound of Theorem 3.1 can be negative. It thus remains
an interesting question for future work, if there exists an
optimal decay scheme which provably works better than
any constant one.

Note that the first and the last term in the regret bound
can be upper bounded by constants. Only the second term

depends on T . Note that kg1:T,i k ≤ T G2 and as δt is
monotonically decreasing, the second term is on the order
of O(log(T )) and thus we have a logarithmic regret bound.
As the bound is data-dependent, in the sense that it depends
on the observed sequence of gradients, it is much tighter
than a data-independent bound.

4. RMSProp and SC-RMSProp
RMSProp is one of the most popular adaptive gradient
algorithms used for the training of deep neural networks
(Schaul et al., 2014; Dauphin et al., 2015; Daniel et al.,
2016; Schmidhuber, 2015). It has been used frequently in
computer vision (Karpathy & Fei-Fei, 2016) e.g. to train
the latest InceptionV4 network (Szegedy et al., 2016a;b).
Note that RMSProp outperformed other adaptive methods
like Adagrad order Adadelta as well as SGD with momentum in a large number of tests in (Schaul et al., 2014). It
has been argued that if the changes in the parameter update
are approximately Gaussian distributed, then the matrix At
can be seen as a preconditioner which approximates the diagonal of the Hessian (Daniel et al., 2016). However, it is
fair to say that despite its huge empirical success in practice and some first analysis in the literature, there is so far
no rigorous theoretical analysis of RMSProp. We will analyze RMSProp given in Algorithm 3 in the framework of
of online convex optimization.

suggestion of (Hinton et al., 2012) to choose βt = 0.9.
It will turn out later in the experiments that the constant
choice of βt leads sometimes to divergence of the sequence,
whereas the choice derived from our theoretical analysis
always leads to a convergent scheme even when applied to
deep neural networks. Thus we think that the analysis in
the following is not only interesting for the convex case but
can give valuable hints how the parameters of RMSProp
should be chosen in deep learning.
Before we start the regret analysis we want to discuss the
sequence vt in more detail. Using the recursive definition
of vt , we get the closed form expression

of that this correspondence of Adagrad and RMSProp has
been observed before.
The proof of the regret bound for RMSProp relies on the
following lemma.
Lemma 4.1 Let Assumptions A1 and A2 and suppose that
1 − 1t ≤ βt ≤ 1 − γt for some 0 < γ ≤ 1, and t ≥ 1. Also

Similar to the extension of Adagrad to SC-Adagrad, we
present in this section SC-RMSProp which achieves a logarithmic regret bound.
Note that again there exist choices for the parameters of
SC-RMSProp such that it reduces to SC-Adagrad. The correspondence is given by the choice

α X (1 − γ)(1 + log T )
2γ i=1 inf j∈[1,T ] jvj,i + jj,i

Note that the regret bound reduces for γ = 1 to that of SCAdagrad. For 0 < γ < 1 a comparison between the bounds
is not straightforward as the vt,i terms cannot be compared.
It is an interesting future research question whether it is
possible to show that one scheme is better than the other
one potentially dependent on the problem characteristics.

5. Experiments
The idea of the experiments is to show that the proposed
algorithms are useful for standard learning problems in
both online and batch settings. We are aware of the fact
that in the strongly convex case online to batch conversion is not tight (Hazan & Kale, 2014), however that does
not necessarily imply that the algorithms behave generally suboptimal. We compare all algorithms for a strongly
convex
and present relative suboptimality plots,
 problem
f (xt )−p∗
, where p∗ is the global optimum, as well
log10
p∗
as separate regret plots, where we compare to the best optimal parameter in hindsight for the fraction of training
points seen so far. On the other hand RMSProp was originally developed by (Hinton et al., 2012) for usage in deep
learning. As discussed before the fixed choice
√ of βt is
not allowed if one wants to get the optimal O( T ) regret
bound in the convex case. Thus we think it is of interest to
the deep learning community, if the insights from the convex optimization case transfer to deep learning. Moreover,
Adagrad and RMSProp are heavily used in deep learning
and thus it is interesting to compare their counterparts SCAdagrad and SC-RMSProp developed for the strongly convex case also in deep learning. The supplementary material
contains additional experiments on various neural network
models.
Datasets: We use three datasets where it is easy, difficult and very difficult to achieve good test performance,
just in order to see if this influences the performance. For
this purpose we use MNIST (60000 training samples, 10
classes), CIFAR10 (50000 training samples, 10 classes)
and CIFAR100 (50000 training samples, 100 classes). We
refer to (Krizhevsky, 2009) for more details on the CIFAR
datasets.

Algorithms: We compare 1) Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) (Bottou, 2010) with O(1/t) decaying step-size for
the strongly convex problems and for non-convex problems

problems. 4) RMSProp as proposed in (Hinton et al., 2012)
is used for both strongly convex problems and non-convex
problems with βt = 0.9 ∀t ≥ 1. 5) RMSProp (Ours) is
used with step-size decay of αt = √αt and βt = 1 − γt .
In order that the parameter range is similar to the original
RMSProp ((Hinton et al., 2012)) we fix as γ = 0.9 for all
experiment (note that for γ = 1 RMSProp (Ours) is equivalent to Adagrad), 6) SC-RMSProp is used with stepsize
αt = αt and γ = 0.9 as RMSProp (Ours) 7) SC-Adagrad
is used with a constant stepsize α. The decaying damping factor for both SC-Adagrad and SC-RMSProp is used
with ξ1 = 0.1, ξ2 = 1 for convex problems and we use
ξ1 = 0.1, ξ2 = 0.1 for non-convex deep learning problems. Finally, the numerical stability parameter δ used in
Adagrad, Adam, RMSProp is set to 10−8 as it is typically
recommended for these algorithms.
Setup: Note that all methods have only one varying parameter: the stepsize α which we choose from the set of
{1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001} for all experiments. By this
setup no method has an advantage just because it has more
hyperparameters over which it can optimize. The optimal
rate is always chosen for each algorithm separately so that
one achieves either best training objective or best test performance after a fixed number of epochs.

Strongly Convex Case - Softmax Regression: Given the
training data (xi , yi )i∈[m] and let yi ∈ [K]. we fit a linear model with cross entropy loss and use as regularization
the squared Euclidean norm of the weight parameters. The
objective is then given as

All methods are initialized with zero weights. The regularization parameter was chosen so that one achieves the
best prediction performance on the test set. The results are
shown in Figure 1. We also conduct experiments in an online setting, where we restrict the number of iterations to
the number of training samples. Here for all the algorithms,
we choose the stepsize resulting in best regret value at the
end. We plot the Regret ( in log scale ) vs dataset proportion seen, and as expected SC-Adagrad and SC-RMSProp
outperform all the other methods across all the considered
datasets. Also, RMSProp (Ours) has a lower regret values
than the original RMSProp as shown in Figure 2.
Convolutional Neural Networks: Here we test a 4-layer
CNN with two convolutional (32 filters of size 3 × 3) and
one fully connected layer (128 hidden units followed by
0.5 dropout). The activation function is ReLU and after

the last convolutional layer we use max-pooling over a 2 ×
2 window and 0.25 dropout. The final layer is a softmax
layer and the final objective is cross-entropy loss. This is
a pretty simple standard architecture and we use it for all
datasets. The results are shown in Figure 3. Both RMSProp
(Ours) and SC-Adagrad perform better than all the other
methods in terms of test accuracy for CIFAR10 dataset. On
both CIFAR100 and MNIST datasets SC-RMSProp is very
competitive.
Residual Network: We also conduct experiments for
ResNet-18 network proposed in (He et al., 2016a) where
the residual blocks are used with modifications proposed
in (He et al., 2016b) on CIFAR10 dataset. We report the
results in Figures 4. SC-Adagrad, SC-RMSProp and RMSProp (Ours) have the best performance in terms of test
Accuracy and RMSProp (Ours) has the best performance
in terms of training objective along with Adagrad.
We also test all the algorithms on a simple 3-layer Multilayer perceptron which we include in the supplementary material. Given these experiments, we think that SCRMSProp and SC-Adagrad are valuable new adaptive gradient techniques for deep learning.

6. Conclusion
We have analyzed RMSProp originally proposed in the
deep learning community in the framework of online convex optimization. We show that the conditions for convergence of RMSProp for the convex case are different than
what is used by (Hinton et al., 2012) and that this leads
to better performance in practice. We also propose variants SC-Adagrad and SC-RMSProp which achieve logarithmic regret bounds for the strongly convex case. Moreover, they perform very well for different network models
and datasets and thus they are an interesting alternative to
existing adaptive gradient schemes. In the future we want
to explore why these algorithms perform so well in deep
learning tasks even though they have been designed for the
strongly convex case.
