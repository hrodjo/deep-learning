Multilevel Clustering via Wasserstein Means

Abstract
We propose a novel approach to the problem of
multilevel clustering, which aims to simultaneously partition data in each group and discover
grouping patterns among groups in a potentially
large hierarchically structured corpus of data.
Our method involves a joint optimization formulation over several spaces of discrete probability
measures, which are endowed with Wasserstein
distance metrics. We propose a number of variants of this problem, which admit fast optimization algorithms, by exploiting the connection to
the problem of finding Wasserstein barycenters.
Consistency properties are established for the estimates of both local and global clusters. Finally,
experiment results with both synthetic and real
data are presented to demonstrate the flexibility
and scalability of the proposed approach. 1

1. Introduction
In numerous applications in engineering and sciences, data
are often organized in a multilevel structure. For instance,
a typical structural view of text data in machine learning
is to have words grouped into documents, documents are
grouped into corpora. A prominent strand of modeling and
algorithmic works in the past couple decades has been to
discover latent multilevel structures from these hierarchically structured data. For specific clustering tasks, one may
be interested in simultaneously partitioning the data in each
group (to obtain local clusters) and partitioning a collection
of data groups (to obtain global clusters). Another concrete
example is the problem of clustering images (i.e., global
clusters) where each image contains partions of multiple
annotated regions (i.e., local clusters) (Oliva and Torralba,

2001). While hierachical clustering techniques may be employed to find a tree-structed clustering given a collection
of data points, they are not applicable to discovering the
nested structure of multilevel data. Bayesian hierarchical
models provide a powerful approach, exemplified by influential works such as (Blei et al., 2003; Pritchard et al.,
2000; Teh et al., 2006). More specific to the simultaneous and multilevel clustering problem, we mention the paper of (Rodriguez et al., 2008). In this interesting work, a
Bayesian nonparametric model, namely the nested Dirichlet process (NDP) model, was introduced that enables the
inference of clustering of a collection of probability distributions from which different groups of data are drawn.
With suitable extensions, this modeling framework has
been further developed for simultaneous multilevel clustering, see for instance, (Wulsin et al., 2016; Nguyen et al.,
2014; Huynh et al., 2016).
The focus of this paper is on the multilevel clustering problem motivated in the aforementioned modeling works, but
we shall take a purely optimization approach. We aim to
formulate optimization problems that enable the discovery
of multilevel clustering structures hidden in grouped data.
Our technical approach is inspired by the role of optimal
transport distances in hierarchical modeling and clustering
problems. The optimal transport distances, also known as
Wasserstein distances (Villani, 2003), have been shown to
be the natural distance metric for the convergence theory
of latent mixing measures arising in both mixture models
(Nguyen, 2013) and hierarchical models (Nguyen, 2016).
They are also intimately connected to the problem of clustering — this relationship goes back at least to the work of
(Pollard, 1982), where it is pointed out that the well-known
K-means clustering algorithm can be directly linked to the
quantization problem — the problem of determining an optimal finite discrete probability measure that minimizes its
second-order Wasserstein distance from the empirical distribution of given data (Graf and Luschgy, 2000).

If one is to perform simultaneous K-means clustering for
hierarchically grouped data, both at the global level (among
groups), and local level (within each group), then this can
be achieved by a joint optimization problem defined with
suitable notions of Wasserstein distances inserted into the
objective function. In particular, multilevel clustering requires the optimization in the space of probability mea-

sures defined in different levels of abstraction, including
the space of measures of measures on the space of grouped
data. Our goal, therefore, is to formulate this optimization
precisely, to develop algorithms for solving the optimization problem efficiently, and to make sense of the obtained
solutions in terms of statistical consistency.
The algorithms that we propose address directly a multilevel clustering problem formulated from a purely optimization viewpoint, but they may also be taken as a fast
approximation to the inference of latent mixing measures
that arise in the nested Dirichlet process of (Rodriguez
et al., 2008). From a statistical viewpoint, we shall establish a consistency theory for our multilevel clustering
problem in the manner achieved for K-means clustering
(Pollard, 1982). From a computational viewpoint, quite
interestingly, we will be able to explicate and exploit the
connection betwen our optimization and that of finding the
Wasserstein barycenter (Agueh and Carlier, 2011), an interesting computational problem that have also attracted much
recent interests, e.g., (Cuturi and Doucet, 2014).
In summary, the main contributions offered in this work include (i) a new optimization formulation to the multilevel
clustering problem using Wasserstein distances defined on
different levels of the hierarchical data structure; (ii) fast algorithms by exploiting the connection of our formulation to
the Wasserstein barycenter problem; (iii) consistency theorems established for proposed estimates under very mild
condition of data’s distributions; (iv) several flexibile alternatives by introducing constraints that encourage the borrowing of strength among local and global clusters, and (v)
finally, demonstration of efficiency and flexibility of our
approach in a number of simulated and real data sets.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides preliminary background on Wasserstein distance, Wasserstein
barycenter, and the connection between K-means clustering and the quantization problem. Section 3 presents several optimization formulations of the multilevel clusering
problem, and the algorithms for solving them. Section 4
establishes consistency results of the estimators introduced
in Section 4. Section 5 presents careful simulation studies
with both synthetic and real data. Finally, we conclude the
paper with a discussion in Section 6. Additional technical
details, including all proofs, are given in the Supplement.

2. Background
For any given subset Θ ⊂ Rd , let P(Θ) denote the space of
Borel probability measures on Θ. The Wasserstein space
of order r ∈ [1, ∞)
 of probability measures on Θ is de
´
fined as Pr (Θ) = G ∈ P(Θ) :
kxkr dG(x) < ∞ ,
where k.k denotes Euclidean metric in Rd .

Addition-

ally, for any k ≥ 1 the probability simplex
 is denoted
k
P
k
by ∆k = u ∈ R : ui ≥ 0,
ui = 1 . Finally, let
i=1

Ok (Θ) (resp., Ek (Θ)) be the set of probability measures
with at most (resp., exactly) k support points in Θ.
Wasserstein distances For any elements G and G0 in
Pr (Θ) where r ≥ 1, the Wasserstein distance of order r
between G and G0 is defined as (cf. (Villani, 2003)):

1/r
ˆ
0
r
Wr (G, G ) =
kx − yk dπ(x, y)
inf 0
π∈Π(G,G )
Θ2

where Π(G, G0 ) is the set of all probability measures on
Θ×Θ that have marginals G and G0 . In words, Wrr (G, G0 )
is the optimal cost of moving mass from G to G0 , where
the cost of moving unit mass is proportional to r-power of
Euclidean distance in Θ. When G and G0 are two discrete
measures with finite number of atoms, fast computation of
Wr (G, G0 ) can be achieved (see, e.g., (Cuturi, 2013)). The
details of this are deferred to the Supplement.
By a recursion of concepts, we can speak of measures of
measures, and define a suitable distance metric on this abstract space: the space of Borel measures on Pr (Θ), to be
denoted by Pr (Pr (Θ)). This is also a Polish space (that
is, complete and separable metric space) as Pr (Θ) is a
Polish space. It will be endowed with a Wasserstein metric of order r that is induced by a metric Wr on Pr (Θ)
as follows (cf. Section 3 of (Nguyen, 2016)): for any
D, D0 ∈ Pr (Pr (Θ))

1/r
ˆ
0
r
0
0
Wr (D, D ) := inf
Wr (G, G )dπ(G, G )
Pr (Θ)2

where the infimum in the above ranges over all π ∈
Π(D, D0 ) such that Π(D, D0 ) is the set of all probability
measures on Pr (Θ) × Pr (Θ) that has marginals D and D0 .
In words, Wr (D, D0 ) corresponds to the optimal cost of
moving mass from D to D0 , where the cost of moving unit
mass in its space of support Pr (Θ) is proportional to the
r-power of the Wr distance in Pr (Θ). Note a slight notational abuse — Wr is used for both Pr (Θ) and Pr (Pr (Θ)),
but it should be clear which one is being used from context.
Wasserstein barycenter Next, we present a brief
overview of Wasserstein barycenter problem, first studied
by (Agueh and Carlier, 2011) and subsequentially many
others (e.g., (Benamou et al., 2015; Solomon et al., 2015;
Álvarez Estebana et al., 2016)). Given probability measures P1 , P2 , . . . , PN ∈ P2 (Θ) for N ≥ 1, their Wasserstein barycenter P N,λ is such that
P N,λ = arg min

Multilevel Clustering via Wasserstein Means

where λ ∈ ∆N denote weights associated with
P1 , . . . , PN . When P1 , . . . , PN are discrete measures with
finite number of atoms and the weights λ are uniform, it
was shown by (Anderes et al., 2015) that the problem of
finding Wasserstein barycenter P N,λ over the space P2 (Θ)
in (1) is reduced to search only over a much simpler space
N
P
Ol (Θ) where l =
si − N + 1 and si is the number of
i=1

components of Pi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N . Efficient algorithms
for finding local solutions of the Wasserstein barycenter
problem over Ok (Θ) for some k ≥ 1 have been studied
recently in (Cuturi and Doucet, 2014). These algorithms
will prove to be a useful building block for our method as
we shall describe in the sequel. The notion of Wasserstein
barycenter has been utilized for approximate Bayesian inference (Srivastava et al., 2015).
K-means as quantization problem The well-known Kmeans clustering algorithm can be viewed as solving an
optimization problem that arises in the problem of quantization, a simple but very useful connection (Pollard, 1982;
Graf and Luschgy, 2000). The connection is the following. Given n unlabelled samples Y1 , . . . , Yn ∈ Θ. Assume
that these data are associated with at most k clusters where
k ≥ 1 is some given number. The K-means problem finds
the set S containing at most k elements θ1 , . . . , θk ∈ Θ that
minimizes the following objective

Let Pn =
δY be the empirical measure of data

Y1 , . . . , Yn . Then, problem (2) is equivalent to finding a
discrete probability measure G which has finite number of
support points and solves:
inf W22 (G, Pn ).
(3)
G∈Ok (Θ)

Due to the inclusion of Wasserstein metric in its formulation, we call this a Wasserstein means problem. This problem can be further thought of as a Wasserstein barycenter
problem where N = 1. In light of this observation, as
noted by (Cuturi and Doucet, 2014), the algorithm for finding the Wasserstein barycenter offers an alternative for the
popular Loyd’s algorithm for determing local minimum of
the K-means objective.

3. Clustering with multilevel structure data
Given m groups of nj exchangeable data points Xj,i where
1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ i ≤ nj , i.e., data are presented in a
two-level grouping structure, our goal is to learn about the
two-level clustering structure of the data. We want to obtain simultaneously local clusters for each data group, and
global clusters among all groups.

3.1. Multilevel Wasserstein Means (MWM) Algorithm
For any j = 1, . . . , m, we denote the empirical measure
nj
1 P
for group j by Pnjj :=
δX . Throughout this secnj i=1 j,i
tion, for simplicity of exposition we assume that the number of both local and global clusters are either known or
bounded above by a given number. In particular, for local
clustering we allow group j to have at most kj clusters for
j = 1, . . . , m. For global clustering, we assume to have M
group (Wasserstein) means among the m given groups.
High level idea For local clustering, for each j =
1, . . . , m, performing a K-means clustering for group j, as
expressed by (3), can be viewed as finding a finite discrete
measure Gj ∈ Okj (Θ) that minimizes squared Wasserstein distance W22 (Gj , Pnjj ). For global clustering, we are
interested in obtaining clusters out of m groups, each of
which is now represented by the discrete measure Gj , for
j = 1, . . . , m. Adopting again the viewpoint of Eq. (3),
provided that all of Gj s are given, we can apply K-means
quantization method to find their distributional clusters.
The global clustering in the space of measures of measures
on Θ can be succintly expressed
by

However, Gj are not known — they have to be optimized
through local clustering in each data group.
MWM problem formulation We have arrived at an objective function for jointly optimizing over both local and
global clusters

We call the above optimization the problem of Multilevel Wasserstein Means (MWM). The notable feature of
MWM is that its loss function consists of two types of distances associated with the hierarchical data structure: one
is distance in the space of measures, e.g., W22 (Gj , Pnjj ),
and the other in space of measures of measures, e.g.,
m
1 P
W22 (H,
δG ). By adopting K-means optimization to
m j=1 j
both local and global clustering, the multilevel Wasserstein
means problem might look formidable at the first sight.
Fortunately, it is possible to simplify this original formulation substantially, by exploiting the structure of H.
Indeed, we can show that formulation (4) is equivalent
to the following optimization problem, which looks much
simpler as it involves only measures on Θ:

where d2W2 (G, H) :=

1≤i≤M

(H1 , . . . , HM ), with each Hi ∈ P2 (Θ). The proof of this
equivalence is deferred to Proposition B.4 in the Supplement. Before going into to the details of the algorithm for
solving (5) in Section 3.1.2, we shall present some simpler cases, which help to illustrate some properties of the
optimal solutions of (5), while providing insights of subsequent developments of the MWM formulation. Readers
may proceed directly to Section 3.1.2 for the description of
the algorithm in the first reading.

where σ in the above sum varies over all the permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n} and the second inequality is due to
Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality. It implies that as long as
W22 (Pni , Pnj ) is small, the optimal solution Gi and Gj of (6)
will be sufficiently close to each other. By letting n → ∞,
we also achieve the same conclusion regarding the asymptotic behavior of Gi and Gj with respect to W2 (P i , P j ).

3.1.1. P ROPERTIES OF MWM IN SPECIAL CASES
Example 1. Suppose kj = 1 and nj = n for all 1 ≤ j ≤

setting, the objective function (5) can be rewritten as

assume that our data Xj,i are i.i.d samples from probability
measure P j having mean µj = EX∼P j (X) for any 1 ≤
j ≤ m, the previous result implies that θi 6→ θj for almost
surely as long as µi 6= µj . As a consequence, if µj are
pairwise different, the multi-level Wasserstein means under
that simple scenario of (5) will not have identical centers
among local groups.
On the other hand, we have W22 (Gi , Gj ) = kθi − θj k2 =

Wasserstein distance

i∈A,j∈A

i.e., the distances of empirical measures Pni and Pnj when
i and j belong to the same set A or Ac are much less than
those when i and j do not belong to the same set. Under
this condition, by using the argument from part (i) we can
write the objective function (5) as

The above objective function suggests that the optimal solutions θi , θj (equivalently, Gi and Gj ) will not be close to
each other as long as i and j do not belong to the same set
A or Ac , i.e., Pni and Pnj are very far. Therefore, the two
groups of “local” measures Gj do not share atoms under
that setting of empirical measures.
The examples examined above indicate that the MWM
problem in general do not “encourage” the local measures
Gj to share atoms among each other in its solution. Additionally, when the empirical measures of local groups are
very close, it may also suggest that they belong to the same
cluster and the distances among optimal local measures Gj
can be very small.
3.1.2. A LGORITHM D ESCRIPTION
Now we are ready to describe our algorithm in the general
case. This is a procedure for finding a local minimum of
Problem (5) and is summarized in Algorithm 1. We prepare the following details regarding the initialization and
updating steps required by the algorithm:

3.2. Multilevel Wasserstein Means with Sharing
As we have observed from the analysis of several specific
cases, the multilevel Waserstein means formulation may
not encourage the sharing components locally among m
groups in its solution. However, enforced sharing has been
demonstrated to be a very useful technique, which leads
to the “borrowing of strength” among different parts of
the model, consequentially improving the inferential efficiency (Teh et al., 2006; Nguyen, 2016). In this section,
we seek to encourage the borrowing of strength among
groups by imposing additional constraints on the atoms of
G1 , . . . , G

in the literature — see for example the work of (Kulis and
Jordan, 2012), who developed an optimization-based approach to the inference of the HDP (Teh et al., 2006), which
also encourages explicitly the sharing of local group means
among local clusters. Now, we can rewrite objective function (7) as follows

from the global atoms Hi of H (t) (Justification of
this reduction is derived from Theorem A.1 in the Supplement). This again can be done by utilizing algorithms from (Cuturi and Doucet, 2014). Note that, as
l(t) becomes very large when m is large, to speed up
the computation of Algorithm 1 we impose a threshold L, e.g., L = 10, for l(t) in its implementation.

of finding local minimums of objective function (8) is to
first, update the elements of constraint set SK to provide the
supports for local measures Gj and then, obtain the weights
of these measures as well as the elements of global set H
by computing appropriate Wasserstein barycenters. Due to
space constraint, the details of these steps of the MWMS
Algorithm (Algorithm 2) are deferred to the Supplement.

We proceed to establish consistency for the estimators introduced in the previous section. For the brevity of the
presentation, we only focus on the MWM method; consistency for MWMS can be obtained in a similar fashion.
Fix m, and assume that P j is the true distribution of data
Xj,i for j = 1, . . . , m. Write G = (G1 , . . . , Gm ) and
n = (n1 , . . . , nm ). We say n → ∞ if nj → ∞ for

In this section, we are interested in evaluating the effectiveness of both MWM and MWMS clustering algorithms by
considering different synthetic data generating processes.
Unless otherwise specified, we set the number of groups
m = 50, number of observations per group nj = 50 in
d = 10 dimensions, number of global clusters M = 5
with 6 atoms. For Algorithm 1 (MWM) local measures
Gj have 5 atoms each; for Algorithm 2 (MWMS) number of atoms in constraint set SK is 50. As a benchmark
for the comparison we will use a basic 3-stage K-means
approach (the details of which can be found in the Supplement). The Wasserstein distance between the estimated
distributions (i.e. Ĝ1 , . . . , Ĝm ; Ĥ1 , . . . , ĤM ) and the data
generating ones will be used as the comparison metric.
Recall that the MWM formulation does not impose constraints on the atoms of Gi , while the MWMS formulation
explicitly enforces the sharing of atoms across these measures. We used multiple layers of mixtures while adding
Gaussian noise at each layer to generate global and local
clusters and the no-constraint (NC) data. We varied number of groups m from 500 to 10000. We notice that the
3-stage K-means algorithm performs the best when there is
no constraint structure and variance is constant across clusters (Fig. 1(a) and 2(a)) — this is, not surprisingly, a favorable setting for the basic K-means method. As soon as we
depart from the (unrealistic) constant-variance, no-sharing
assumption, both of our algorithms start to outperform the
basic three-stage K-means. The superior performance is
most pronounced with local-constraint (LC) data (with or
without constant variance conditions). See Fig. 1(c,d). It is
worth noting that even when group variances are constant,
the 3-stage K-means is no longer longer effective because
now fails to account for the shared structure. When m = 50
and group sizes are larger, we set SK = 15. Results are reported in Fig. 2 (c), (d). These results demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of our both algorithms.
5.2. Real data analysis
We applied our multilevel clustering algorithms to two realworld datasets: LabelMe and StudentLife.
LabelMe dataset consists of 2, 688 annotated images
which are classified into 8 scene categories including tall
buildings, inside city, street, highway, coast, open country, mountain, and forest (Oliva and Torralba, 2001) . Each
image contains multiple annotated regions. Each region,
which is annotated by users, represents an object in the
image. As shown in Figure 4, the left image is an image
from open country category and contains 4 regions while
the right panel denotes an image of tall buildings category

including 16 regions. Note that the regions in each image
can be overlapped. We remove the images containing less
then 4 regions and obtain 1, 800 images.
We then extract GIST feature (Oliva and Torralba, 2001)
for each region in a image. GIST is a visual descriptor to represent perceptual dimensions and oriented spatial structures of a scene. Each GIST descriptor is a 512dimensional vector. We further use PCA to project GIST
features into 30 dimensions. Finally, we obtain 1, 800
“documents”, each of which contains regions as observations. Each region now is represented by a 30-dimensional
vector. We now can perform clustering regions in every image since they are visually correlated. In the next level of
clustering, we can cluster images into scene categories.

pervasive and ubiquitous computing research. Data signals

consist of multiple channels (e.g., WiFi signals, Bluetooth
scan, etc.), which are collected from smartphones of 49 students at Dartmouth College over a 10-week spring term in
2013. However, in our experiments, we use only WiFi signal strengths. We applied a similar procedure described in
(Nguyen et al., 2016) to pre-process the data. We aggregate the number of scans by each Wifi access point and
select 500 Wifi Ids with the highest frequencies. Eventually, we obtain 49 “documents” with totally approximately
4.6 million 500-dimensional data points.
Experimental results. To quantitatively evaluate our proposed methods, we compare our algorithms with several
base-line methods: K-means, three-stage K-means (TSKmeans) as described in the Supplement, MC2-SVI without
context (Huynh et al., 2016). Clustering performance in
Table 1 is evaluated with the image clustering problem for
LabelMe dataset. With K-means, we average all data points

algorithm: tag-clouds on the left are accumulated from all images in the clusters while six images on the right are randomly
chosen images in that cluster; (b) StudentLife discovered network with three node groups: (1) discovered student clusters,
(3) student nodes, (5) discovered activity location (from Wifi data); and two edge groups: (2) Student to cluster assignment,

edge sizes between Student and activity location represent the popularity of student’s activities.
to obtain a single vector for each images. K-means needs
much less time to run since the number of data points is
now reduced to 1, 800. For MC2-SVI, we used stochastic
varitational and a parallelized Spark-based implementation
in (Huynh et al., 2016) to carry out experiments. This implementation has the advantage of making use of all of 16
cores on the test machine. The running time for MC2-SVI
is reported after scanning one epoch. In terms of clustering
accuracy, MWM and MWMS algorithms perform the best.
Fig. 3a demonstrates five representative image clusters
with six randomly chosen images in each (on the right)
which are discovered by our MWMS algorithm. We also
accumulate labeled tags from all images in each cluster to
produce the tag-cloud on the left. These tag-clouds can be
considered as visual ground truth of clusters. Our algorithm can group images into clusters which are consistent
with their tag-clouds.
We use StudentLife dataset to demonstrate the capability of
multilevel clustering with large-scale datasets. This dataset
not only contains a large number of data points but presents
in high dimension. Our algorithms need approximately 1
hour to perform multilevel clustering on this dataset. Fig.
3b presents two levels of clusters discovered by our algorithms. The innermost (blue) and outermost (green) rings
depict local and global clusters respectively. Global clusters represent groups of students while local clusters shared
between students (“documents”) may be used to infer loca-

tions of students’ activities. From these clusteing we can
dissect students’ shared location (activities), e.g. Student
49 (U49) mainly takes part in activity location 4 (L4).

6. Discussion
We have proposed an optimization based approach to multilevel clustering using Wasserstein metrics. There are several possible directions for extensions. Firstly, we have
only considered continuous data; it is of interest to extend
our formulation to discrete data. Secondly, our method requires knowledge of the numbers of clusters both in local
and global clustering. When these numbers are unknown, it
seems reasonable to incorporate penalty on the model complexity. Thirdly, our formulation does not directly account
for the “noise” distribution away from the (Wasserstein)
means. To improve the robustness, it may be desirable to
make use of the first-order Wasserstein metric instead of
the second-order one. Finally, we are interested in extending our approach to richer settings of hierarchical data, such
as one when group level-context is available.
