Abstract
Given a graphical model, one essential problem is MAP inference, that is, finding the most
likely configuration of states according to the
model. Although this problem is NP-hard, large
instances can be solved in practice and it is a
major open question is to explain why this is
true. We give a natural condition under which we
can provably perform MAP inference in polynomial time—we require that the number of fractional vertices in the LP relaxation exceeding the
optimal solution is bounded by a polynomial in
the problem size. This resolves an open question
by Dimakis, Gohari, and Wainwright. In contrast, for general LP relaxations of integer programs, known techniques can only handle a constant number of fractional vertices whose value
exceeds the optimal solution. We experimentally
verify this condition and demonstrate how efficient various integer programming methods are
at removing fractional solutions.

The MAP problem on binary, pairwise graphical models
contains, as a special case, the Max-cut problem and is
therefore NP-hard. For this reason, a significant amount of
attention has focused on analyzing the LP relaxation of the
ILP, which can be solved efficiently in practice.

This relaxation has been an area of intense research in machine learning and statistics. In (Meshi et al., 2016), the authors state that a major open question is to identify why real
world instances of Problem (2) can be solved efficiently despite the theoretical worst case complexity.
We make progress on this open problem by analyzing the
fractional vertices of the LP relaxation, that is, the extreme points of the polytope with fractional coordinates.
Vertices of the relaxed polytope with fractional coordinates
are called pseudomarginals for graphical models and pseudocodewords in coding theory. If a fractional vertex has
higher objective value (i.e. likelihood) compared to the best
integral one, the LP relaxation fails. We call fractional vertices with an objective value at least as good as the objective

value of the optimal integral vertex confounding vertices.
Our main result is that it is possible to prune all confounding vertices efficiently when their number is polynomial.
Our contributions:
• Our first contribution is a general result on integer programs. We show that any 0-1 integer linear program
(ILP) can be solved exactly in polynomial time, if the
number confounding vertices is bounded by a polynomial. This applies to MAP inference for a graphical
model over any alphabet size and any order of connection. The same result (exact solution if the number of confounding vertices is bounded by a polynomial) was established by (Dimakis et al., 2009) for the
special case of LP decoding of LDPC codes (Feldman et al., 2005). The algorithm from (Dimakis et al.,
2009) relies on the special structure of the graphical
models that correspond to LDPC codes. In this paper
we generalize this result for any ILP in the unit hypercube. Our results extend to finding all integral vertices
among the M -best vertices.
• Given our condition, one may be tempted to think that
we generate the top M -best vertices of a linear program (for M polynomial) and output the best integral
one in this list. We actually show that such an approach would be computationally intractable. Specifically, we show that it is NP-hard to produce a list
of the M -best vertices if M = O(nε ) for any fixed
ε > 0. This result holds even if the list is allowed
to be approximate. This strengthens the previously
known hardness result (Angulo et al., 2014) which
was M = O(n) for the exact M -best vertices. In
terms of achievability, the best previously known result (from (Angulo et al., 2014)) can only solve the
ILP if there is at most a constant number of confounding vertices.
• We obtain a complete characterization of the fractional vertices of the local polytope for binary, pairwise graphical models. We show that any variable in
the fractional support must be connected to a frustrated cycle by other fractional variables in the graphical model. This is a complete structural characterization that was not previously known, to the best of our
knowledge.
• We develop an approach to estimate the number of
confounding vertices of a half-integral polytope. We
use this method in an empirical evaluation of the
number of confounding vertices of previously studied
problems and analyze how well common integer programming techniques perform at pruning confounding
vertices.

2. Background and Related Work
For some classes of graphical models, it is possible to solve
the MAP problem exactly. For example see (Weller et al.,
2016) for balanced and almost balanced models, (Jebara,
2009) for perfect graphs, and (Wainwright et al., 2008) for
graphs with constant tree-width.
These conditions are often not true in practice and a wide
variety of general purpose algorithms are able to solve the
MAP problem for large inputs. One class is belief propagation and its variants (Yedidia et al., 2000; Wainwright et al.,
2003; Sontag et al., 2008). Another class involves general
ILP optimization methods (see e.g. (Nemhauser & Wolsey,
1999)). Techniques specialized to graphical models include
cutting-plane methods based on the cycle inequalities (Sontag & Jaakkola, 2007; Komodakis & Paragios, 2008; Sontag et al., 2012). See also (Kappes et al., 2013) for a comparative survey of techniques.
In (Weller et al., 2014), the authors investigate how pseudomarginals and relaxations relate to the success of the Bethe
approximation of the partition function.
There has been substantial prior work on improving inference building on these LP relaxations, especially for
LDPC codes in the information theory community. This
work ranges from very fast solvers that exploit the special structure of the polytope (Burshtein, 2009), connections to unequal error protection (Dimakis et al., 2007),
and graphical model covers (Koetter et al., 2007). LP
decoding currently provides the best known finite-length
error-correction bounds for LDPC codes both for random
(Daskalakis et al., 2008; Arora et al., 2009), and adversarial bit-flipping errors (Feldman et al., 2007).
For binary graphical models, there is a body of work which
tries to exploit the persistency of the LP relaxation, that
is, the property that integer components in the solution of
the relaxation must take the same value in the optimal solution, under some regularity assumptions (Boros & Hammer, 2002; Rother et al., 2007; Fix et al., 2012).
Fast algorithms for solving large graphical models in practice include (Ihler et al., 2012; Dechter & Rish, 2003).
The work most closely related to this paper involves eliminating fractional vertices (so-called pseudocodewords in
coding theory) by changing the polytope or the objective
function (Zhang & Siegel, 2012; Chertkov & Stepanov,
2008; Liu et al., 2012).

3. Provable Integer Programming
A binary integer linear program is an optimization problem
of the following form.
max
x

cT x

subject to Ax ≤ b
x ∈ {0, 1}n
which is relaxed to a linear program by replacing the x ∈
{0, 1}n constraint with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. For binary integer programs with the box constraints 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1 for all i, every
integral vector x is a vertex of the polytope described by
the constraints of the LP relaxation. However fraction vertices may also be in this polytope, and fractional solutions
can potentially have an objective value larger than every
integral vertex.
If the optimal solution to the linear program happens to
be integral, then this is the optimal solution to the original
integer linear program. If the optimal solution is fractional,
then a variety of techniques are available to tighten the LP
relaxation and eliminate the fractional solution.
We establish a success condition for integer programming
based on the number of confounding vertices, which to the
best of our knowledge was unknown. The algorithm used
in proving Theorem 1 is a version of branch-and-bound, a
classic technique in integer programming (Land & Doig,
1960) (see (Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1999) for a modern reference on integer programming). This algorithm works by
starting with a root node, then branching on a fractional
coordinate by making two new linear programs with all the
constraints of the parent node, with the constraint xi = 0
added to one new leaf and xi = 1 added to the other. The
decision on which leaf of the tree to branch on next is based
on which leaf has the best objective value. When the best
leaf is integral, we know that this is the best integral solution. This algorithm is formally written in Algorithm 1.
Theorem 1. Let x∗ be the optimal integral solution and let
{v1 , v2 , . . . , vM } be the set of confounding vertices in the
LP relaxation. Algorithm 1 will find the optimal integral
solution x∗ after 2M calls to an LP solver.
Since MAP inference is a binary integer program regardless
of the alphabet size of the variables and order of the clique
potentials, we have the following corollary:
Corollary 2. Given a graphical model such that the local
polytope has M as cofounding variables, Algorithm 1 can
find the optimal MAP configuration with 2M calls to an LP
solver.
Cutting-plane methods, which remove a fractional vertex
by introducing a new constraint in the polytope may not
have this property, since this cut may create new confound-

ing vertices. This branch-and-bound algorithm has the desirable property that it never creates a new fractional vertex.
We note that other branching algorithms, such as the algorithm presented by the authors in (Marinescu & Dechter,
2009), do not immediately allow us to prove our desired
theorem.
Note that warm starting a linear program with slightly
modified constraints allows subsequent calls to an LP
solver to be much more efficient after the root LP has been
solved.
3.1. Proof of Theorem 1
The proof follows from the following invariants:
• At every iteration we remove at least one fractional
vertex.
• Every integral vertex is in exactly one branch.
• Every fractional vertex is in at most one branch.
• No fractional vertices are created by the new constraints.

Exact MAP Inference by Avoiding Fractional Vertices

To see the last invariant, note that every vertex of a polytope
can be identified by the set of inequality constraints that are
satisfied with equality (see (Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis, 1997)).
By forcing an inequality constraint to be tight, we cannot
possibly introduce new vertices.
3.2. The M -Best LP Problem
As mentioned in the introduction, the algorithm used to
prove Theorem 1 does not enumerate all the fractional vertices until it finds an integral vertex. Enumerating the M best vertices of a linear program is the M -best LP problem.
Definition. Given a linear program {min cT x : x ∈ P }
over a polytope P and a positive integer M , the M -best LP
problem is to optimize

max

{v1 ,...,vM }⊆V (P )

M
X

cT vk .

k=1

This was established by (Angulo et al., 2014) to be NP-hard
when M = O(n). We strengthen this result to hardness of
approximation even when M = nε for any ε > 0.
Theorem 3. It is NP-hard to approximate the M -best LP
ε
problem by a factor better than O( nM ) for any fixed ε > 0.
Proof. Consider the circulation polytope described in
(Khachiyan et al., 2008), with the graph and weight vector
w described in (Boros et al., 2011). By adding an O(log M )
long series of 2×2 bipartite subgraphs, we can make it such
that one long path in the original graph implies M long
paths in the new graph, and thus it is NP-hard to find any
of these long paths in the new graph. By adding the constraint vector wT x ≤ 0, and using the cost function −w,
the vertices corresponding to the short paths have value
1/2, the vertices corresponding to the long paths have value
O(1/n), and all other vertices have value 0. Thus the optimal set has value O(n + M
n ). However it is NP-hard to find
a set of value greater than O(n) in polynomial time, which
n
gives an O( M
) approximation. Using a padding argument,
we can replace n with nε .
The best known algorithm for the M -best LP problem is
a generalization of the facet guessing algorithm (Dimakis
et al., 2009) developed in (Angulo et al., 2014), which
would require O(mM ) calls to an LP solver, where m is
the number of constraints of the LP. Since we only care
about integral solutions, we can find the single best integral
vertex with O(M ) calls to an LP solver, and if we want all
of the K-best integral solutions among the top M vertices
of the polytope, we can find these with O(nK + M ) calls
to an LP-solver, as we will see in the next section.

3.3. K-Best Integral Solutions
Finding the K-best solutions to general optimization problems has been uses in several machine learning applications. Producing multiple high-value outputs can be
naturally combined with post-processing algorithms that
select the most desired solution using additional sideinformation. There is a significant volume of work in the
general area, see (Fromer & Globerson, 2009; Batra et al.,
2012) for MAP solutions in graphical models and (Eppstein, 2014) for a survey on M -best problems.
We further generalize our theorem to find the K-best integral solutions.
Theorem 4. Under the assumption that there are less than
M fractional vertices with objective value at least as good
as the K-best integral solutions, we can find all of the Kbest integral solutions, O(nK + M ) calls to an LP solver.
The algorithm used in this theorem is Algorithm 2. It combines Algorithm 1 with the space partitioning technique
used in (Murty, 1968; Lawler, 1972). If the current optimal
solution in the solution tree is fractional, then we use the
branching technique in Algorithm 1. If the current optimal
solution in the solution tree x∗ is integral, then we branch
by creating a new leaf for every i not currently constrained
by the parent with the constraint xi = ¬x∗i .

4. Fractional Vertices of the Local Polytope
We now describe the fractional vertices of the local polytope for binary, pairwise graphical models, which is described in Equation 3. It was shown in (Padberg, 1989) that
all the vertices of this polytope are half-integral, that is, all
coordinates have a value from {0, 12 , 1} (see (Weller et al.,
2016) for a new proof of this).
Given a half-integral point q ∈ {0, 12 , 1}V ∪E in the local
polytope, we say that a cycle C = (VC , EC ) ⊆ G is frustrated if there is an odd number of edges ij ∈ EC such that
qij = 0. If a point q has a frustrated cycle, then it is a pseudomarginal, as no probability distribution exists that has
as its singleton and pairwise marginals the coordinates of
q. Half-integral points q with a frustrated cycle do not satisfy the cycle inequalities (Sontag & Jaakkola, 2007; Wainwright et al., 2008), for all cycles C = (VC , EC ), F =
(VF , EF ) ⊆ C, |EF | odd we must have

Frustrated cycles allow a solution to be zero on negative
weights in a way that is not possible for any integral solution.
We have the following theorem describing all the vertices
of the local polytope for binary, pairwise graphical models.

Theorem 5. Given a point q in the local polytope, q is a
vertex of this polytope if and only if q ∈ {0, 12 , 1}V ∪E and
the induced subgraph on the fractional nodes of q is such
that every connected component of this subgraph contains
a frustrated cycle.
4.1. Proof of Theorem 5
Every vertex q of an n-dimensional polytope is such that
there are n constraints such that q satisfies them with equality, known as active constraints (see (Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis, 1997)). Every integral q is thus a vertex of the local
polytope. We now describe the fractional vertices of the local polytope.
Definition. Let q ∈ {0, 12 , 1}n+m be a point of the local
polytope. Let GF = (VF , EF ) be an induced subgraph of
points such that qi = 12 for all i ∈ VF . We say that GF is

(5)

Theorem 5 follows from the following lemmas.
Lemma 6. Let q ∈ {0, 12 , 1}n+m be a point of the local
polytope. Let GF = (VF , EF ) be the subgraph induced by
the nodes i ∈ V such that qi = 12 . The point q is a vertex if
and only if every connected component of GF is full rank.
Lemma 7. Let q ∈ {0, 12 , 1}n+m be a point of the local
polytope. Let GF = (VF , EF ) be a connected subgraph
induced from nodes such that such that qi = 12 for all i ∈
VF . GF is full rank if and only if GF contains cycle that is
full rank.
Lemma 8. Let q ∈ {0, 12 , 1}n+m be a point of the local
polytope. Let C = (VC , EC ) be a cycle of G such that qi is
fractional for all i ∈ VC . C is full rank if and only if C is a
frustrated cycle.
Proof of Lemma 6. Suppose every connected component is
full rank. Then every fractional node and edge between
fractional nodes is fully specified by their corresponding
equations in Problem 3. It is easy to check that all integral
nodes, edges between integral nodes, and edges between
integral and fractional nodes is also fixed. Thus q is a vertex.
Now suppose that there exists a connected component that
is not full rank. The only other constraints involving this
connected component are those between fractional nodes
and integral nodes. However, note that these constraints are
always rank 1, and also introduce a new edge variable. Thus
all the constraints where q is tight do not make a full rank
system of equations.
Proof of Lemma 7. Suppose GF has a full rank cycle. We
will build the graph starting with the full rank cycle then
adding one connected edge at a time. It is easy to see from
Equations 5 that all new variables introduced to the system
of equations have a fixed value, and thus the whole connected component is full rank.
Now suppose GF has no full rank cycle. We will again
build the graph starting from the cycle then adding one connected edge at a time. If we add an edge that connects to a
new node, then we added two variables and two equations,
thus we did not make the graph full rank. If we add an edge
between two existing nodes, then we have a cycle involving
this edge. We introduce two new equations, however with

Exact MAP Inference by Avoiding Fractional Vertices

one of the equations and the other cycle equations, we can
produce the other equation, thus we can increase the rank
by one but we also introduced a new edge. Thus the whole
graph cannot be full rank.

The proof of Lemma 8 from the following lemma.
Lemma 9. Consider a collection of n vectors
v1 = (1, t1 , 0, . . . , 0)
v2 = (0, 1, t2 , 0, . . . , 0)
v3 = (0, 0, 1, t3 , 0, . . . , 0)
..
.
vn−1 = (0, . . . , 0, 1, tn−1 )
vn = (tn , 0, . . . , 0, 1)
for ti ∈ {−1, 1}. We have rank(v1 , v2 , . . . , vn ) = n if and
only if there is an odd number of vectors such that ti = 1.
Proof of Lemma 9. Let k be the number of vectors such
that ti = 1. Let S1 = v1 and define
(
Si − vi+1 if Si (i + 1) = 1
Si+1 =
Si + vi+1 if Si (i + 1) = −1
for i = 2, . . . , n − 1.
Note that if ti+1 = −1 then Si+1 (i + 2) = Si (i + 1) and if
ti+1 = 1 then Si+1 (i + 2) = −Si (i + 1). Thus the number
of times the sign changes is exactly the number of ti = 1
for i ∈ {2, . . . , n − 1}.
Using the value of Sn−1 we can now we can check for all
values of t1 and tn that the following is true.
• If k is odd then (1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ span(v1 , v2 , . . . , vn ),
which allows us to create the entire standard basis,
showing the vectors are full rank.
• If k is even then vn ∈ span(v1 , v2 , . . . , vn−1 ) and
thus the vectors are not full rank.

We will call a vertex (x, z) fractional if its x component
is fractional. For each fractional vertex (x, z), we create a
half-integral vector S(x) such that


0 if xi = 0
S(x)i = 21 if xi is fractional


1 if xi = 1
For a set of vertices V , we define S(V ) to be the set {S(x) :
(x, z) ∈ V }, i.e. we remove all duplicate entries.
Theorem 10. Let (x∗ , z ∗ ) be the optimal integral solution and let VC be the set of confounding vertices. Algorithm 1 will find the optimal integral solution (x∗ , z ∗ ) after
2|S(VC )| calls to an LP solver.
For MAP inference in graphical models, S(VC ) refers to
the fractional singleton marginals qV such that there exists
a set of pairwise pseudomarginals qE such that (qV , qE ) is
a cofounding vertex. In this case we call qV a confounding
singleton marginal. We develop Algorithm 3 to estimate the
number of confounding singleton marginals for our experiments section. It is based on the k-best enumeration method
developed in (Murty, 1968; Lawler, 1972).
Algorithm 3 works by a branching argument. The root node
is the original LP. A leaf node is branched on by introducing a new leaf for every node in V and every element of
{0, 12 , 1} such that qi 6= a in the parent node and the constraint {qi = a} is not in the constraints for the parent node.
For i ∈ V , a ∈ {0, 12 , 1}, we create the leaf such that it has
all the constraints of its parents plus the constraint qi = a.
Note that Algorithm 3 actually generates a superset of the
elements of S(VC ), since the introduction of constraints of
the type qi = 21 introduce vertices into the new polytope
that were not in the original polytope. This does not seem
to be an issue for the experiments we consider, however this
does occur for other graphs. An interesting question is if the
vertices of the local polytope can be provably enumerated.

Singleton Marginals

6. Experiments

For this section we generalize generalize Theorem 1. We
see after every iteration we potentially remove more than
one confounding vertex—we remove all confounding vertices that agree with xI0 = 0 and xI1 = 1 and are fractional
with any value at coordinate i. We also observe that we can

We consider a synthetic experiment on randomly created
graphical models, which were also used in (Sontag &
Jaakkola, 2007; Weller, 2016; Weller et al., 2014). The
graph topology used is the complete graph on 12 nodes. We
first reparametrize the model to use the sufficient statistics

determines how strong the connections are between nodes.
We do 100 draws for each choice of edge strength w.
For the complete graph, we observe that Algorithm 3 does
not yield any points that do not correspond to vertices, however this does occur for other topologies.
We first compare how the number of fractional singleton
marginals |S(VC )| changes with the connection strength w.
In Figure 1, we plot the sample CDF of the probability that
|S(VC )| is some given value. We observe that |S(VC )| increases as the connection strength increases. Further we see
that while most instances have a small number for |S(VC )|,
there are rare instances where |S(VC )| is quite large.
Now we compare how the number of cycle constraints from
Equation (4) that need to be introduced to find the best integral solution changes with the number of confounding
singleton marginals in Figure 2. We use the algorithm for
finding the most frustrated cycle in (Sontag & Jaakkola,
2007) to introduce new constraints. We observe that each
constraint seems to remove many confounding singleton

Figure 1. We compare how the number of fractional singleton
marginals |S(VC )| changes with the connection strength w. We
plot the sample CDF of the probability that |S(VC )| is some
given value. We observe that |S(VC )| increases as the connection strength increases. Further we see that while most instances
have a small number for |S(VC )|, there are rare instances where
|S(VC )| is quite large.

marginals.
We also observe the number of introduced confounding
singleton marginals that are introduced by the cycle constraints increases with the number of confounding singleton marginals in Figure 3.
Finally we compare the number of branches needed to find
the optimal solution increases with the number of confounding singleton marginals in Figure 4. A similar trend
arises as with the number of cycle inequalities introduced.
To compare the methods, note that branch-and-bound uses
twice as many LP calls as there are branches. For this family of graphical models, branch-and-bound tends to require
less calls to an LP solver than the cut constraints.

7. Conclusion
Perhaps the most interesting follow-up question to our
work is to determine when, in theory and practice, our condition on the number of confounding pseudomarginals in
the LP relaxation is small. Another interesting question is
to see if it is possible to prune the number of confounding
pseudomarginals at a faster rate. The algorithm presented
for our main theorem removes one pseudomarginal after
two calls to an LP solver. Is it possible to do this at a faster
rate? From our experiments, this seems to be the case in
practice.
