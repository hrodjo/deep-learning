Abstract

X × X from which we obtain binary feedback {0, 1} that
represents whether or not x is preferred over x0 (has lower
value)1 . We will consider that x is the winner of the duel if
the output is {1} and that x0 wins the duel if the output is
{0}. The goal here is to find xmin by reducing as much as
possible the number of queried duels.

Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged during
the last few years as an effective approach to optimizing black-box functions where direct queries
of the objective are expensive. In this paper we
consider the case where direct access to the function is not possible, but information about user
preferences is. Such scenarios arise in problems
where human preferences are modeled, such as
A/B tests or recommender systems. We present
a new framework for this scenario that we call
Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) which
allows us to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be queried through pairwise
comparisons, the so-called duels. PBO extends
the applicability of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by
modeling the probability of the winner of each
duel by means of a Gaussian process model with
a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO. We
illustrate the benefits of PBO in a variety of experiments, showing that PBO needs drastically fewer
comparisons for finding the optimum. According
to our experiments, the way of modeling correlations in PBO is key in obtaining this advantage.

Our setup is different to the one typically used in BO where
direct feedback from g in the domain is available (Jones,
2001; Snoek et al., 2012). In our context, the objective
is a latent object that is only accessible via indirect observations. However, although the scenario described in this
work has not received a wider attention, there exist a variety of real wold scenarios in which the objective function
needs to be optimized via preferential returns. Most cases
involve modeling latent human preferences, such as web
design via A/B testing, the use of recommender systems
(Brusilovsky et al., 2007) or the ranking of game players
skills (Herbrich et al., 2007). In prospect theory, the models
used are based on comparisons with some reference point,
as it has been demonstrated that humans are better at evaluating differences rather than absolute magnitudes (Kahneman
and Tversky, 1979).

1. Introduction
Let g : X → < be a well-behaved black-box function
defined on a bounded subset X ⊆ <q . We are interested in
solving the global optimization problem of finding
xmin = arg min g(x).
x∈X

We assume that g is not directly accessible and that queries
to g can only be done in pairs of points or duels [x, x0 ] ∈

Optimization methods for pairwise preferences have been
studied in the armed-bandits context (Yuea et al., 2012).
Zoghi et al. (2014) propose a new method for the K-armed
duelling bandit problem based on the Upper Confidence
Bound algorithm. Jamieson et al. (2015) study the problem
by allowing noise comparisons between the duels. Zoghi
et al. (2015b) choose actions using contextual information.
Dudı́k et al. (2015) study the Copeland’s dueling bandits,
a case in which a Condorcet winner, or an arm that uniformly wins the duels with all the other arms may not exist. Szörényi et al. (2015) study Online Rank Elicitation
problem in the duelling bandits setting. An analysis on
Thompson sampling in duelling bandits is done by Wu et al.
(2016). Yue and Joachims (2011) proposes a method that
does not need transitivity and comparison outcomes to have
independent and time-stationary distributions.

ilarly, Brochu (2010) used a probabilistic model to actively
learn preferences in the context of discovering optimal parameters for simple graphics and animations engines. To
select new duels, standard acquisition functions like the Expected Improvement (EI) (Mockus, 1977) are extended on
top of a GP model with likelihood for duels. Although this
approach is simple an effective in some cases, new duels are
selected greedily, which may lead to over-exploitation.
In this work we propose a new approach aiming at combining the good properties of the arm-bandit methods with the
advantages of having a probabilistic model able to capture
correlations across the points in the domain X . Following
the above mentioned literature in the bandits settings, the
key idea is to learn a preference function in the space of the
duels by using a Gaussian process. This allows us to select
the most relevant comparisons non-greedily and improve
the state-of-the-art in this domain.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the point of view that it is followed in this work to
model latent preferences. We define concepts such as the
Copeland score function and the Condorcet’s winner which
form the basis of our approach. Also in Section 2, we show
how to learn these objects from data. In Section 3 we generalize most commonly used acquisition functions to the
dueling case. In Section 4 we illustrate the benefits of the
proposed framework compared to state-of-the art methods
in the literature. We conclude in Section 5 with a discussion
and some future lines of research.

2. Learning latent preferences
The approach followed in this work is inspired by the work
of (Ailon et al., 2014) in which cardinal bandits are reduced
to ordinal ones. Similarly, here we focus on the idea of
reducing the problem of finding the optimum of a latent
function defined on X to determine a sequence of duels on
X × X.

We assume that each duel [x, x0 ] produces in a joint reward
f ([x, x0 ]) that is never directly observed. Instead, after each
pair is proposed, the obtained feedback is a binary return y ∈
{0, 1} representing which of the two locations is preferred.
In this work, we assume that f ([x, x0 ]) = g(x0 ) − g(x),
but other alternatives are possible. Note that the more x is
preferred over x0 the bigger is the reward.
Since the preferences of humans are often unclear and may
conflict, we model preferences as a stochastic process. In
particular, the model of preference is a Bernoulli probability
function
p(y = 1|[x, x0 ]) = πf ([x, x0 ])
and
p(y = 0|[x, x0 ]) = πf ([x, x0 ])
where π : < × < → [0, 1] is an inverse link function. Via
the latent loss, f maps each query [x, x0 ] to the probability
of having a preference on the left input x over the right
input x0 . The inverse link function has the property that
πf ([x0 , x]) = 1 − πf ([x, x0 ]). A natural choice for πf is

Preferential Bayesian Optimization

the logistic function
πf ([x, x0 ]) = σ(f ([x, x0 ])) =

1
,
1 + e−f ([x,x0 ])

(2)

but others are possible. Note that for any duel [x, x0 ] in
which g(x) ≤ g(x0 ) it holds that πf ([x, x0 ]) ≥ 0.5. πf
is therefore a preference function that fully specifies the
problem.
We introduce here the concept of normalised Copeland
score, already used in the literature of raking methods
(Zoghi et al., 2015a), as
Z
−1
S(x) = Vol(X )
I{πf ([x,x0 ])≥0.5} dx0 ,
X

where Vol(X ) = X dx0 is a normalizing constant that
bounds S(x) in the interval [0, 1]. If X is a finite set, the
Copeland score is simply the proportion of duels that a certain element x will win with probability larger than 0.5.
Instead of the Copeland score, in this work we use a soft version of it, in which the probability function πf is integrated
over X without further truncation. Formally, we define the
soft-Copeland score as
Z
C(x) = Vol(X )−1
πf ([x, x0 ])dx0 ,
(3)
R

X

which aims to capture the ‘averaged’ probability of x being
the winner of a duel.
Following the armed-bandits literature, we say that xc is
a Condorcet winner if it is the point with maximal softCopeland score. It is straightforward to see that if xc is a
Condorcet winner with respect to the soft-Copeland score,
it is a global minimum of f in X : the integral in (3) takes
maximum value for points x ∈ X such that f ([x, x0 ]) =
g(x0 ) − g(x) > 0 for all x0 , which only occurs if xc is a
minimum of f . This implies that if by observing the results
of a set of duels we can learn the preference function πf the
optimization problem of finding the minimum of f can be
addressed by finding the Condorcet winner of the Copeland
score. See Figure 1 for an illustration of this property.
2.1. Learning the preference function πf ([x, x0 ]) with
Gaussian processes

closed forms for the posterior mean and variance are available. In the preference learning, like the one we face here,
the basic idea behind Gaussian process modeling is to place
a GP prior over some latent function f that captures the
membership of the data to the two classes and to squash it
through the logistic function to obtain some prior probability πf . In other words, the model for a GP for classification
looks similar to eq. (2) but with the difference that f is an
stochastic process as it is πf . The stochastic latent function
f is a nuisance function as we are not directly interested
in its values but instead on particular values of πf at test
locations [x? , x0? ].
Inference is divided in two steps. First we need to compute
the distribution of the latent variable corresponding to a test
case, p(f? |D, [x? , x0? ], θ) and later use this distribution over
the latent f? to produce a prediction
πf ([x? , x0? ]; D, θ)

= p(y? = 1|D, [x, x0 ], θ)
(4)
Z
=
σ(f? )p(f? |D, [x? , x0? ], θ)df?

where the vector θ contains the hyper-parameters of the
model that can also be marginalized out. In this scenario,
GP predictions are not straightforward (in contrast to the regression case), since the posterior distribution is analytically
intractable and approximations at required (see (Rasmussen
and Williams, 2005) for details). The important message
here is, however, that given data from the locations and result of the duels we can learn the preference function πf by
taking into account the correlations across the duels, which
makes the approach to be very data efficient compared to
bandits scenarios where correlations are ignored.
2.2. Computing the soft-Copeland score and the
Condorcet winner
The soft-Copeland function can be obtained by integrating πf ([x, x0 ]) over X , so it is possible to learn the softCopeland function from data by integrating πf ([x, x0 ], D).
Unfortunately, a closed form solution for

In a nutshell, a GP is a probability measure over functions
such that any linear restriction is multivariate Gaussian. Any
GP is fully determined by a positive definite covariance operator. In standard regression cases with Gaussian likelihoods,

where x1 , . . . , xM are a set of landmark points to perform
the integration. For simplicity, in this work we select the
landmark points uniformly, although more sophisticated
probabilistic approaches can be applied (Briol et al., 2015).

Figure 2. Differences between the sources of uncertainty that can be used for the exploration of the duels. The three figures show different
elements of a GP used for preferential learning in the context of the optimization of the (latent) Forrester function. The model is learned
using the result of 30 duels. Left: Expectation of y? , which coincides with the expectation of σ(f? ) and that is denoted as πf ([x? , x0? ].
Center: Variance of output of the duels y? , that is computed as πf ([x? , x0? ](1 − πf ([x? , x0? ]). Note that the variance does not necessarily
decrease in locations where observations are available. Right: Variance of the latent function σ(f? ). The variance of σ(f? ) decreases in
regions where data are available, which make it appropriate for duels exploration contrast to the variance of y? .

The Condorcet winner can be computed by taking
xc = arg max C(x; D, θ),
x∈X

which can be done using a standard numerical optimizer. xc
is the point that has, on average, the maximum probability of
wining most of the duels (given the data set D) and therefore
it is the most likely point to be the optimum of g.

3. Sequential Learning of the Condorcet
winner
In this section we analyze the case in which n extra duels
can be carried out to augment the dataset D before we have
to report a solution to (1). This is similar to the set-up in
(Brochu, 2010) where interactive Bayesian optimization is
proposed by allowing a human user to sequentially decide
the result of a number of duels.
In the sequel, we will denote by Dj the data set resulting
of augmenting D with j new pairwise comparisons. Our
goal in this section is to define a sequential policy for querying duels: α([x, x0 ]; Dj , θ). This policy will enable us to
identify as soon as possible the minimum of the the latent
function g. Note that here, differently to the situation in
standard Bayesian optimization, the search space of the
acquisition, X × X is not the same as domain X of the
latent function that we are optimizing. Our best guess about
its optimum, however, is the location of the Condorcet’s
winner.
We approach the problem by proposing three dueling acquisition functions: (i) pure exploration (PE), the Copeland
Expected improvement (CEI) and duelling-Thompson sampling, which makes explicitly use of the generative capabilities of our model. We analyze the three approaches in

terms of what the balance exploration-exploitation means in
our context. For simplicity in the notation, in the sequel we
drop the dependency of all quantities on the parameters θ.
3.1. Pure Exploration
The first question that arises when defining a new acquisition
for duels, is what exploration means in this context. Given
a model as described in Section 2.1, the output variables y?
follow a Bernoulli distribution with probability given by the
preference function πf . A straightforward interpretation of
pure exploration would be to search for the duel of which
the outcome is most uncertain (has the highest variance of
y? ). The variance of y? is given by
V[y? |[x? , x0? ], Dj ] = πf ([x? , x0? ]; Dj )(1−πf ([x? , x0? ]; Dj )).
However, as preferences are modeled with a Bernoulli
model, the variance of y? does not necessarily reduce with
sufficient observations. For example, according to eq. (2),
for any two values x? and x0? such that g(x? ) ≈ g(x0? ),
πf ([x? , x0? ], Dj ) will tend to be close to 0.5, and therefore
it will have maximal variance even if we have already collected several observations in that region of the duels space.
Alternatively, exploration can be carried out by searching
for the duel where GP is most uncertain about the probability
of the outcome (has the highest variance of σ(f? )), which
is the result of transforming out epistemic uncertainty about
f , modeled by a GP, through the logistic function. The
first order moment of this distribution coincides with the
expectation of y? but its variance is
Z

V[σ(f? )] =
(σ(f? ) − E[σ(f? )]) p(f? |D, [x, x0 ])df?

generalize the idea to our context we need to find a couple
of duels able to maximally improve the expected score of
the Condorcet winner.

augmenting D with {[x, x0 ], 1} and by c?x0 ,j the equivalent
value but augmenting the dataset with {[x, x0 ], 0}. We define the one-lookahead Copeland Expected Improvement at

which explicitly takes into account the uncertainty over f .
Hence, pure exploration of duels space can be carried out
by maximizing
αPE ([x, x0 ]|Dj ) = V[σ(f? )|[x? , x0? ]|Dj ].
Remark that in this case, duels that have been already visited
will have a lower chance of being visited again even in cases
in which the objective takes similar values in both players.
See Figure 2 for an illustration of this property.
In practice, this acquisition requires to compute and intractable integral, that we approximate in practice using
Monte-Carlo.
3.2. Copeland Expected Improvement
An alternative way to define an acquisition function is
by generalizing the idea of the Expected Improvement
(Mockus, 1977). The idea of the EI is to compute, in expectation, the marginal gain with respect to the current best
observed output. In our context, as we do not have direct
access to the objective, our only way of evaluating the quality of a single point is by computing its Copeland score. To

where (·)+ = max(0, ·) and the expectation is take over c,
the value at the Condorcet winner given the result of the
duel. The next duel is selected as the pair that maximizes
the CEI. Intuitively, the CEI evaluated at [x, x0 ] is a weighted
sum of the total increase of the best possible value of the
Copeland score in the two possible outcomes of the duel.
The weights are chosen to be the probability of the two
outcomes, which are given by πf . The CEI can be computed
in closed form as
αCEI ([x, x0 ]|Dj )

= πf ([x, x0 ]|Dj )(c?x,j − c?j )+

+ πf ([x0 , x]|Dj )(c?x0 ,j − c?j )+
The computation of this acquisition is computationally demanding as it requires updating of the GP classification
model for every fantasized output at any point in the domain. As we show in the experimental section, and similarly with what is observed in the literature about the EI, this
acquisition tends to be greedy in certain scenarios leading
to over exploitation (Hernández-Lobato et al., 2014; Hennig
and Schuler, 2012). Although non-myopic generalizations
of this acquisition are possible to address this issue in the
same fashion as in (González et al., 2016b) these are be
intractable.
3.3. Dueling-Thompson sampling
As we have previously detailed, pure explorative approaches
that do not exploit the available knowledge about the current best location and CEI is expensive to compute and tends
to over-exploit. In this section we propose an alternative
acquisition function that is fast to compute and explicitly balances exploration and exploitation. We call this acquisition
dueling-Thompson sampling and it is inspired by Thompson
sampling approaches. It follows a two-step policy for duels:
1. Step 1, selecting x: First, generate a sample f˜ from
the model using continuous Thompson sampling 2 and

The term Vol(X )−1 in the Copeland score has been
dropped here as it does not change the location of the
optimum. The goal of this step is to balance exploration
and exploitation in the selection of the Condorcet winner, it is the same fashion Thompson sampling does:
it is likely to select a point close to the current Condorcet winner but the policy also allows exploration of
other locations as we base our decision on a stochastic
f˜. Also, the more evaluations are collected, the more
greedy the selection will be towards the Condorcet
winner. See Figure 3 for an illustration of this effect.

In summary the dueling-Thompson sampling approach selects the next duel as:

2. Step 2, selecting x0 : Given xnext the second element
of the duel is selected as the location that maximizes
the variance of σ(f? ) in the direction of xnext . More
formally, x0next is selected as

This second step is purely explorative in the direction
of xnew and its goal is to find informative comparisons
to run with current good locations identified in the
previous step.
invariant kernel can be obtained by using Bochner’s theorem
(Bochner et al., 1959). In a nutshell, the idea is to approximate the
kernel by means of the inner product of a finite number Fourier features that are sampled according to the measure associated to the
kernel (Rahimi and Recht, 2008; Hernández-Lobato et al., 2014).

where xnext and xnext are defined above. This policy combines a selection of a point with high chances of being the
optimum with a point whose result of the duel is uncertain
with respect of the previous one. Note that this has some interesting connections with uncertain sampling as presented
in (Houlsby et al., 2011). See Figure 4 for a visual illustration of the two steps in toy example. See Algorithm 1 for a
full description of the PBO approach.
3.4. Generalizations to multiple returns scenarios
A natural extension of the PBO set-up detailed above are
cases in which multiple comparisons of inputs are simultaneously allowed. This is equivalent to providing a ranking
over a set of points x1 , . . . , xk . Rankings are trivial to map
to pairwise preferences by using the pairwise ordering to

Figure 5. Averaged results across 4 latent objective functions and 6 different methods. The CEI is only computed in the Forrester function
as it is intractable when the dimension increases. Results are computed over 20 replicates in which 5 randomly selected initial points
are used to initialize the models and that are kept the same across the six methods. The horizontal axis of the plots represents the
number of evaluation and the vertical axis represent the value (log scale in the second row) of the true objective function at the best
guess (Condorcet winner) at each evaluation. Note that this is only possible as we know the true objective function.The curves are not
necessarily monotonically decreasing as we do not show the current best solution but the current solution at each iteration (proposed
location by each method at each step in a real scenario).

obtain the result of the duels. The problem is, therefore,
equivalent from a modeling perspective. However, from the
point of view of selecting the k locations to rank in each
iteration, generalization of the above mentioned acquisitions
are required. Although this is not the goal of this work, it is
interesting to remark that this problem has strong connections with the one of computing batches in BO (González
et al., 2016a).

4. Experiments
We present three experiments which validate our approach
in terms of performance and illustrate its key properties. The
set-up is as follows: we have a non-linear black-box function
g(x) of which we look for its minimum as described in
equation (1). However, we can only query this function
through pairwise comparisons. The outcome of a pairwise
comparison is generated as described in Section 2, i.e., the
outcome is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution of which the
sample probability is computed according to equation (2).
We have considered for g(x) the Forrester, the ‘six-hump

camel’, ‘Gold-Stein’ and ‘Levy’ as latent objective functions to optimize. The Forrester function is 1-dimensional,
whereas the rest are defined in domains of dimension 2. The
explicit formulation of these objectives and the domains in
which they are optimized are available as part of standard
optimization benchmarks3 . The PBO framework is applicable in the continuous setting. In this section, however,
the search of the optimum of the objectives is performed in
a grid of size (33 per dimension for all cases), which has
practical advantages: the integral in eq. (5) can easily be
treated as a sum and, more importantly, we can compare
PBO with bandit methods that are only defined in discrete
domains. Each comparison starts with 5 initial (randomly
selected) duels and a total budget of 200 duels are run, after
which, the best location of the optimum should be reported.
Further, each algorithm runs for 20 times (trials) with different initial duels (the same for all methods) 4 5 . We report the
average performance across all trials, which is defined as
the value of g (known in all cases) evaluated at the current

Figure 6. Comparison of the bandits Sparring algorithm and PBODTS on the Six-Hump Camel for an horizon in which the bandit
method is run for 4000 iterations. The horizontal line represents
the solution proposed by PBO-DTS after 200 duels. As the plot
illustrates, modeling correlations across the 900 arms (points in
2D) with a GP drastically improves the speed at which the optimum
of the function is found. Note that the bandit method needs to visit
at least each arm before starting to get any improvement while
PBO - DTS is able to make a good (initial) guess with the first 5
random duels used in the experiment. Similar results are obtained
for the rest of functions.

Condorcet winner, xc considered to be the best by each
algorithm at each one of the 200 steps taken until the end of
the budget. Note that each algorithm chooses xc differently,
which leads to different performance at step 0. Therefore,
we present plots of #iterations versus g(xc ).
We compare 6 methods. Firstly, the three variants within the
PBO framework: PBO with pure exploration ( PBO - PE , see
section 3.1), PBO with the Copeland Expected Improvement
(PBO-CEI, see section 3.2) and PBO with dueling Thomson sampling (PBO-DTS, see section 3.3). We also compare against a random policy where duels are drawn from
a uniform distribution (RAMDOM) 6 and with the interactive Bayesian optimization (IBO) method of (Brochu, 2010).
IBO selects duels by using an extension of Expected Improvement on a GP model that encodes the information of
the preferential returns in the likelihood. Finally, we compared against all three cardinal bandit algorithms proposed
by Ailon et al. (2014), namely Doubler, MultiSBM and
Sparring. Ailon et al. (2014) observes that Sparring has
the best performance, and it also outperforms the other two
bandit-based algorithms in our experiments. Therefore, we
only report the performance for Sparring to keep the plots
clean. In a nutshell, the Sparring considers two bandit players (agents), one for each element of the duel, which use the
Upper Confidence Bound criterion and where the input grid
is acting as the set of arms. The decision for which pair of
arms to query is according to the strategies and beliefs of
each agent. In this case, correlations in f are not captured.

xc is chosen as the location that wins most frequently.

Figure 5 shows the performance of the compared methods,
which is consistent across the four plots: IBO shows a poor
performance, due to the combination of the greedy nature of
the acquisitions and the poor calibration of the model. The
RAMDOM policy converges to a sub-optimal result and the
PBO approaches tend to be the superior ones. In particular,
we observe that PBO-DTS is consistently proven as the best
policy, and it is able to balance correctly exploration and
exploitation in the duels space. Contrarily, PBO-CEI, which
is only used in the first experiment due to the excessive
computational overload, tends to over exploit. PBO-PE obtains reasonable results but tends to work worse in larger
dimensions where is harder to cover the space.
Regarding the bandits methods, they need a much larger
number of evaluations to converge compared to methods
that model correlations across the arms. They are also heavily affected by an increase of the dimension (number of
arms). The results of the Sparring method are shown for the
Forrester function but are omitted in the rest of the plots (the
number of used evaluations used is smaller than the numbers
of the arms and therefore no real learning can happen within
the budget). However, in Figure 6 we show the comparison
between Sparring and PBO-DTS for an horizon in which the
bandit method has almost converged. The gain obtained by
modeling correlations among the duels is evident.

5. Conclusions
We have explored a new framework, PBO, for optimizing
black-box functions in which only preferential returns are
available. The fundamental idea is to model comparisons
of pairs of points with a Gaussian, which leads to the definition of new policies for augmenting the available dataset.
We have proposed three acquisitions for duels, PE, CEI and
DTS , and explored their connections with existing policies
in standard BO. Via simulation, we have demonstrated the
superior performance of DTS, both because it finds a good
balance between exploration and exploitation in the duels
space and because it is computationally tractable. In comparison with other alternatives out of the PBO framework,
such as IBO or other bandit methods, DTS shows the state-ofthe-art performance. There exist several future extensions
of our current approach like tackling the existing limitation on the dimension of the input space, which is doubled
with respect to the original dimensionality of the problem.
Also further theoretical analysis will be carried out on the
proposed acquisitions.
