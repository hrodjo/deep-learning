A Birth-Death Process for Feature Allocation
Konstantina Palla 1 David Knowles 2 Zoubin Ghahramani 3 4

Abstract
We propose a Bayesian nonparametric prior over
feature allocations for sequential data, the birthdeath feature allocation process (BDFP). The
BDFP models the evolution of the feature allocation of a set of N objects across a covariate (e.g. time) by creating and deleting features.
A BDFP is exchangeable, projective, stationary
and reversible, and its equilibrium distribution
is given by the Indian buffet process (IBP). We
show that the Beta process on an extended space
is the de Finetti mixing distribution underlying
the BDFP. Finally, we present the finite approximation of the BDFP, the Beta Event Process
(BEP), that permits simplified inference. The
utility of the BDFP as a prior is demonstrated on
real world dynamic genomics and social network
data.

1. Introduction - Problem Statement
We are interested in time series settings where we observe
data {Yt ∈ Y : t = 1, . . . , L}. We consider problems
where the observations are explained by a latent structure
which assigns objects to features and this feature allocation changes over time. For instance, consider the topics covered by a number of newspapers over time; some
topics “die” while new ones are “born”. The topic coverage of each paper is its latent feature allocation which
could be modelled with an Indian buffet process (Griffiths
& Ghahramani, 2011, IBP). While static feature allocation
models are well studied, these are not able to handle the
time series nature of many datasets. We propose a process
that extends the IBP by allowing the feature allocation to
evolve over the covariate as a result of “birth” and “death”
of features.

2. Related Work
We target problems where the data depends on a covariate,
such as time or space, and is explained by a latent structure, in particular a (multi-membership) clustering of the
data points. The observations are result of the underlying
partitioning and its evolution over the covariate. Typical
models fall in two main categories: clustering and feature
allocation. The former allow each data point to belong to
one and only one class (cluster), while the latter let each
data point belong to multiple groups (features). Bayesian
nonparametric approaches are primarily based on the Chinese restaurant process (CRP, Aldous, 1983) or the Indian
buffet process (IBP, Griffiths & Ghahramani, 2005) corresponding to the two categories. In particular, a sample from a CRP is an assignment of data points to disjoint classes (a clustering), while a sample from an IBP is
an allocation of the data points to (possibly) overlapping
classes (a feature allocation). Dependent nonparametric
processes extend distributions over partitions to distributions over collections of partitions indexed by locations in
some covariate space, such as R+ (e.g. continuous time),
Z (e.g. discrete time), or Rd (e.g. geographical location).
Teh et al. (2013) define such a process based on the duality between Kingman’s coalescent (Kingman, 1982) and
the Dirichlet diffusion tree (Neal, 2003). In the resulting
“Fragmentation-Coagulation” process (FCP) a partitioning
of the data points evolves over the covariate undergoing
fragmentation and coagulation events while maintaining
CRP marginals. More recently, Palla et al. (2013) derived
a dependent partition-valued process (DPVP) on an arbitrary covariate space which, like the FCP, is exchangeable
and has CRP distributed marginals. In the setting of feature allocations, Williamson et al. (2010) propose a nonparametric process, the dependent IBP (dIBP), with IBP
distributed marginals and in which the feature allocations
are coupled over the covariate space using a Gaussian process (GP, Rasmussen & Williams, 2006). In a similar vein,
Van Gael et al. (iFHMM, 2009) define the Markov Indian
Buffet process (mIBP), a probability distribution over a potentially infinite number of binary Markov chains evolving
in discrete time. They use the mIBP to extend the factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM, Ghahramani & Jordan,
1997) to the infinite FHMM (iFHMM).
In this paper, we address the problem of dependence for

A Birth-Death Process for Feature Allocation

binary latent feature models. We propose a process that extends the IBP by allowing features to be “born” and “die”
at times learnt by the model, while maintaining the essential mathematical properties of the IBP. The process is a
Markov Jump process (MJP) where the events are the birth
or the death of a feature. The idea is closely related to the
FCP where the events are either a fragmentation of a cluster or a coagulation of two clusters. The partitions at each
location in the FCP are marginally a sample from a Chinese restaurant process, while the feature allocations in the
BDFP are marginally samples from an IBP. Compared to
the dIBP, both processes model feature allocations evolving over the covariate. However, while in the dIBP the
assignment of data points to a feature might change over
the covariate, in our process, it remains the same until the
feature dies. In the case of the iFHMM, the authors model
the dependence of a feature allocation on a discrete time
variable as opposed to our process where continuous covariate space is assumed. Moreover, in the iFHMM, the
marginal distribution of a feature allocation is analogous
but not equal to an IBP. We call the proposed process the
birth-death feature allocation process (BDFP). The BDFP
is exchangeable, projective, stationary and reversible, and
its equilibrium distribution is given by the Indian buffet
process.

3. Feature Allocations and the Indian Buffet
Process
Consider a dataset with N data points indexed by integers
[N ] := {1, 2, . . . , N } (allowing N → ∞). Each datapoint n is associated with a binary vector Zn of length
K that defines its feature allocation; Znk = 1 if datapoint n has feature k and Znk = 0 otherwise. The potential total number of features K may be infinite. The
binary matrix Z[N ] = [ZT1 , ZT2 , . . . , ZTN ]T specifies a random feature allocation of [N ], while ZN denotes the space
of all feature allocations of [N ], i.e. Z[N ] ∈ ZN . We define mk as the number of datapoints that possess feature
P2N −1
k, K+ = h=1 Kh as the number of features for which
mk > 0 and Kh as the multiplicity of feature h, that is
the number of times the same binary column h appears in
Z[N ] . Under the IBP (Griffiths & Ghahramani, 2011), the
probability of a matrix Z[N ] is

Thibaux & Jordan (2007) showed one can construct the Indian buffet process from a Beta-Bernoulli process using the

where B =

a draw B is sampled from the Beta process BP(cµ0 )
(Hjort, 1990) with µ0 as the base distribution. B is a set
of pairs (ωk , θk ) sampled from a Poisson process on the
product space [0, 1] × Θ with Lévy intensity ν(dω, dθ) =
cω −1 (1 − ω)c−1 dωµ0 (dθ). Then, B is used as the atomic
hazard measure for a Bernoulli process BeP(B). Each
Zn is a draw from the Bernoulli process and constitutes
a collection of atoms of unit mass on Θ. Then, Zn is
a binary vector containing the {fk }∞
k=1 values resulting
from tossing a countably infinite sequence of (conditionally independent) coins with success probabilities ωk , i.e.
fk |ωk ∼ Bernoulli(ωk ). This construction allows the use
of de Finetti’s theorem (de Finetti, 1931) that lets the joint
distribution of the rows to be written as

where B is the random measure that renders the variables
Zn conditionally independent. Equation (3) shows the exchangeability of the rows of Zn , since they can be described as a mixture of Bernoulli processes.

4. Birth-Death Process for Feature Allocation
We consider a continuous-time Markov process (Z(t))t≥0
in which each Z(t) is a random feature allocation taking values in the discrete space ZN . The state space is
countably infinite; it is determined by all the possible feature allocations defined by N datapoints and K features,
where K → ∞. The Markov process (Z(t)) evolves over
time jumping to different states (feature allocations). Let
{t1 , . . . , tJ ∈ R : J ∈ N} denote the times when the chain
jumps such that tj = inf{τ ≥ tj−1 : Z(τ ) 6= Z(tj−1 )}
and Z(tj ) ∈ ZN . These jumps are a result of a birth or
a death of a feature. The process (Z(t)) can only jump to
neighbouring states, i.e. if the chain is currently at state
Z(tj ) = s, then at time tj+1 it transitions to Z(tj+1 ) = s0
where a new feature is created or an existing feature is
deleted after a birth or a death event respectively. Let
s
ZN
⊂ ZN be the discrete space of neighboring states to
state s. The process is time homogeneous with transition
probabilities P(Z(t + y) = s0 |Z(y) = s) = P(Z(t) =
s0 |Z(0) = s) = pss0 (t) for all t, y, where s, s0 ∈ Z N . At
time tj+1 the process jumps to the next state Z(tj+1 ) = s0
with rate determined by the current state Z(t) = s and the
corresponding event, i.e birth or death. More specifically,
• Birth: Suppose s ∈ ZN is a feature allocation with

Theorem 1. The Markov process (Z(t))t≥0 is irreducible
and has stationary distribution IBP(α). Furthermore, it is
reversible.
Proof. A continuous time Markov chain is irreducible if it
is possible to eventually get from every state to every other
state with positive probability. It is reversible if detailed
balance holds, i.e. there is a probability distribution π on
ZN such that πs qss0 = πs0 qs0 s for all s, s0 ∈ ZN . Then π is
also the invariant (equilibrium) distribution of the Markov
chain. The chain in BDFP is irreducible, because for any
T > 0 and any two distinct feature allocations γ, ρ ∈ ZN ,
there is a positive probability that if it starts at γ ∈ ZN ,
it will end at ρ ∈ ZN . Reversibility and the equilibrium
distribution can be demonstrated by detailed balance. Suppose γ, ρ are feature allocations such that γ, ρ ∈ ZN and ρ
differs from γ in that it has one additional feature a of size
|a|. The number of (nonzero) features in ρ is Kρ = Kγ +1.

where g(γ; α) is the probability of a feature allocation γ
under the IBP as defined in Equation (1), qγρ is the transition rate from state γ to state ρ, Hγ , Hρ are the number of
distinct features in states γ and ρ respectively and ra is the
multiplicity (the times the feature is present at the current
feature allocation) of feature a that dies. Detailed balance
holds, and as such the process is reversible and the equilibrium distribution is IBP[N ] (α).
Assume that (z(t)) is a realization of the BDFP (Z(t))
over the finite interval [0, T ], T > 0 and we write
(z(t))0≤t≤T . With probability one the sample path
(z(t))0≤t≤T will only contain a finite number of jump
events, each of which is either a birth or a death event. We
write B and Q to denote the set of the features created or
turned off by birth or death events respectively.
Proposition 1. Writing q(t) = qz(t) to denote the total
transition rate out of state z(t), the probability of a realization (z(t)) under the law of the BDFP is:

4.1. Dependent Beta Process Construction
The BDFP process can be constructed using a nonhomogenous Poisson process Π. Consider the Lévy measure ν(dωdxdtb dtω ) on a product space [0, 1] ⊗ X ⊗ R ⊗
[0, ∞). A sample corresponds to set of points Π =
{ωk , xk , tkb , tkω }k where the range of k is countably infinite.
Each atom corresponds to a feature and is associated with
a weight ωk ∈ [0, 1], a location xk , a birth time tkb ∈ R
and a life-span tkω ∈ [0, ∞) (Figure 1). The Lévy measure
is of the form ν(dωdxdtb dtω ) = ρ(dω)µ(dxdtb dtω ) and

X ⊗ R ⊗ [0, ∞) with ρ(dω) = αω −1 (1 − ω)α−1 and base
measure µ(dθ) = µ(dxdtb dtw ). Setting g(dtb ) = dtb and
β(dtω ) = D exp−Dtω dtω , the base measure is µ(dθ) =
µ0 (dx)g(dtb )β(dtω ) = µ0 (dx)dtb D exp−Dtω dtω , where
D is the death rate. The constant measure g(dtb ) over the
real line R is infinite but σ-finite, that is the total measure
g(R) = ∞, but there is a measurable partition (Ek ) of R
with each g(Ek )R < ∞.
R Since ν(dωdθ) integrates to infinity but satisfies [0,1] Θ (1 ∧ |ω|)ν(dωdθ) < ∞, a countably infinite number of i.i.d. random points P

are obtained from the Poisson process and k=1 ωk is finite with probability one. A Beta process is a completely
random measure (Kingman,P1967) and, as such, a sample

where the atoms θ k = {xk , tkb , tkω } ∈ Θ and weights

Proposition 2. The BDFP is exchangeable and the Beta
process BP(αµ) on X⊗R⊗[0, ∞) describes its underlying
mixing measure.
Proof. Consider a sequence of variables (zn (t))T with
n = 1, 2, . . . , N such that each (zn (t))T is the feature allocation evolution of object n over the index space T. These
variables are not independent since each (zn (t))T depends
on the Z|[n−1] (t) = (z1:(n−1) (t))T . However, given a sample from the B ∼ BP(αµ) described in Section 4.1, each
variable (zn (t))T becomes conditionally independent and
the following holds

P ((z1 (t))T , (z2 (t))T , . . . , (zN (t))T ) =

with bnk |ωk ∼ Bernoulli(ωk ) and n = 1, . . . , N . The binary matrix S of dimension N × K, is a feature potential
matrix. Each binary element Snk indicates whether object
n possesses feature fk . S is a global variable and doesn’t
depend on time t. At any time t, the feature allocation matrix Z(t) is a deterministic function of the current features
present at t, that is {fk : tkb < t < tkb + tkw , k = 1, . . . , ∞}

where φ = BP(αµ).
Equation (9) is the de Finetti representation of the BDFP
and as such the BDFP is exchangeable and the BP on
Θ = X ⊗ R ⊗ [0, ∞) is its underlying mixing measure.
Restricting our focus on each index t, the overall Beta process BP(αµ) on X ⊗ R ⊗ [0, ∞) results in a set of dependent random measures over X, one Bt for each t ∈ T, such
that each Bt is marginally a Beta process. Consider a fixed
time point t ∈ T and the space [0, 1] ⊗ X (the red vertical
plane in Figure 1). The point process on this plane (where
blue lines intersect the plane) corresponds to features alive
at time t, i.e. t ∈ [tb , tb + tω ]. The Lévy measure on this
plane, is calculated by projecting the overall Lévy measure
onto the plane,

The resulting feature allocation process (zn (t))T is equivalent to the following: every time a new feature fk is created,
each object n joins with probability ωk , i.e. znk (tkb )|ωk ∼
Bernoulli(ωk ). If znk (tkb ) = 1, object n will possess feature fk until tkb + tkω . Repeat this process for all objects.

where νt is a measure over [0, 1] ⊗ X for a specific t ∈ T.
More specifically, it is the Lévy measure of a Beta process

µt (dx) = µ0 D
. Thus we have that marginally
Bt |α, µt ∼ BP(αµt ), ∀t ∈ T.
(11)
The restricted and projected measure at any index t ∈ T defines a Beta process. Two draws, Bt and Bs , with t, s ∈ T,
will be dependent with the amount of dependence decreasing as |s − t| increases.
Proposition 3. The dependent Beta process construction
presented has IBP marginals at any t.

A Birth-Death Process for Feature Allocation

Proof. At any t ∈ T, Bt |α, µt ∼ BP(αµt ). It is straightforward to see that, marginally, the feature allocation matrix Zt obtained using the generative process in Equation (8) is equivalent to Zt |Bt ∼ BeP(Bt ) and therefore
Zt ∼ IBP(α), ∀t ∈ T.
Corollary 1. At any t ∈ T, the feature allocation matrix
Zt can be generated by the following generative model as
K → ∞:
 
R
, Znk |ωk ∼ Bernoulli(ωk ) (12)
ωk |α ∼ Beta
K
for k = 1, . . . , K and n = 1, . . . , N
The proof of the corollary in included in the supplementary
material. Note that the above is true only marginally, i.e.
at time t ∈ T and it doesn’t generste dependence structure
between Zt ’s.
We underline the dependence of Zs and Zt when |s − t| →
0, ∀s, t ∈ T. The closer s, t are, the more the atoms
(features) Bs and Bt share. If we independently sampled
Zs |Bs ∼ BeP(Bs ) and Zt |Bt ∼ BeP(Bt ) then Zs , Zt
would be dependent, but not equal, even as |s − t| → 0.
However, in the BDFP the presence of the same features results in the same (not just similar) allocation as |s − t| → 0.
In both cases, the marginal distribution of the feature allocation matrix at any t ∈ T is Zt |Bt ∼ BeP(Bt ) and
Zt |α ∼ IBP(α). The BDFP results in a continuous evolud

tion of the Z(t) over T: formally Zt → Zs as t → s.
This construction of the BDFP resembles the spatial normalised Gamma process (SNΓP) by (Rao & Teh, 2009).
The main difference lies in the marginal distribution; the
SNΓP admits DP marginals as opposed to the Beta process
marginals of the dependent Beta process as shown in Equation (11).
Proposition 4. The feature allocation process described
by Equation (8) with B ∼ BP(αµ), has the same birth and
death rates as the BDF process.

5. Finite Model
For the BDFP, the inference simplifies considerably if we
consider a finite approximation which gives the countably infinite model in the limit. Consider the space
S = [0, 1] ⊗ X ⊗ [0, T ] ⊗ [0, ∞), where we restrict the
space of tb to be [0, T ] instead of the whole real line
R. This accounts for typical applications of the model
where we observe data at distinct times over a finite
time range. Consider the Lévy measure ν(dωdxdtb dtω )
on the space S. Then, under the dependent Beta process representation (see section 4.1),
R the expected number of atoms present in S is S ν(dωdxdtb dtω ) =

length of each line indicates the life span of each feature sampled from Exponential(D). To sample feature allocations from
the process, we consider random time points across time, e.g. t, t0
and draw imaginary red lines. The feature allocation matrix at t
involves the features that are crossing the red line at t. The membership of the objects n = 1, . . . , N to those features is defined
by the values of the corresponding elemnts in the potential matrix

we allow inference on a finite model which approximates
the infinite case with increasing fidelity as K → ∞.
The process is depicted in Figure 2 and the infinite case can
be derived as the limit K → ∞ of the following:
• Consider a time range [0, T ] and a set of features F,
such that |F| ∼ Poisson(KT ). Assign to each feature
fk ∈ F, k = 1, . . . |F| a weight ω, such that ωk ∼

, 1 and Ω = [ω1 , ω2 . . . ω|F | ].
• Associate each feature fk ∈ F, k = 1, . . . |F| with
a birth time tkb uniformly sampled in [0, T ]; tkb ∼
|F |
U(0, T ) and tb = [t1b . . . tb ].
• For each fk ∈ F, sample its life span tkw ∼
Exponential(D), where D is the death rate. Define
the time of death tkd as tkd = tkb + tkw and tw =
|F |
[t1w . . . tw ].
We call the sequence of the above steps Beta Event Process (BEP). Putting everything together, generate a sample
B = {F, Ω, tb , tw } ∼ BEP(α, R, K, T ) as follows:

In the case of dynamic binary network data we extend
the latent feature relational model (LFRM) proposed by
(Miller et al., 2009). Let Yt be the N × N binary matrix
that contains links, i.e. ytij = Yt (i, j) = 1 iff we observe
a link from entity i to entity j at time t. We assume that the
matrices Yt are symmetric and ignore diagonal elements
(self-links). The probability of a link from one entity to another is determined by the combined effect of all pairwise
feature interactions. Let Wt be a |F| × |F| real-valued
weight matrix where Wt (k, k 0 ) is the weight that affects
the probability of there being a link from entity i to entity
j if entity i has feature k on, i.e. Ztik = Zt (i, k) = 1 and

Likelihood models. We consider two different likelihood

For the linear-Gaussian likelihood model, consider a sequence of observations {Yt ∈ Y : t = 1, . . . , L} generated
as
Y t = Z t A + t

(15)

where Yt is a N × M observation matrix at each time t =

5.1. Inference
As with many other Bayesian models, exact inference
is intractable so we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) for posterior inference over the latent variables
of the finite model. A detailed description is provided in
the supplementary material.

6. Experiments
We experimentally evaluate the BEP model on real-world
genomics and social network data. To evaluate the model
fit, we compared the BEP model to independent models at
each time point.
6.1. Circadian Rhythm Dataset
Here we used a subset of the gene expression data from
Piechota et al. (2010), including N = 500 genes in D = 4
different conditions (exposure to different drugs) over L =
24 time intervals. The measurements indicate how active
a gene is at different times. We created 7 train-test splits
holding out 20% of the data, and ran 700 MCMC iterations. We see that in terms of predictive performance the
BEP outperforms independent IBP models (Table 1). The
genes belonging to each factor show enrichment for different known biological pathways (Figure 4). Of particular
note are the tryptophan metabolism genes enriched in factor 2, given tryptophan’s suspected effects on drowsiness;

A Birth-Death Process for Feature Allocation

the vasopressin regulated water reabsorption, given this
hormone’s known circadian regulation (Earnest & Sladek,
1986; Yamaguchi et al., 2013); and the regulation of insulin producing beta cells, another hormone with circadian
variation (Shi et al., 2013).
Table 1. Circadian dataset results using 20% held out data, a truncation level of K = 10, |F| = 24, 700 iterations and a burnin of
500. Results are the average over 7 MCMC chains.

6.2. ChIP-seq Epigenetic Marks
For this experiment we used ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) data downloaded from the ENCODE project (Consortium, 2007), representing histone
modifications and transcription factor binding in human
neural crest cell lines (see (Park, 2009) for a nice review).
The observations involve counts associated with N = 14
(human) cell lines and D = 10 proteins. The counts indicate what proteins, with what chemical modifications, are
bound to DNA along the genome. The measurements are
stored in N × D matrix of counts Yt : for each cell line,
how many reads for each of the 10 proteins mapped to bin t
(100 base pair (bp) region of the genome). t = 1, . . . , 500
bins were considered at the start of chromosome 1 (50K
bp in total). In Figure 5(a) each subfigure corresponds to
one of the 10 proteins and in each subfigure the counts for
the N = 14 cell lines are plotted over the genome section of length 50Kbp. Before inference, the raw counts
were square-root transformed (a standard variance stabilizing transform for Poisson data) to make the Gaussian
likelihood appropriate. We ran 7 different held-out tests,
holding out a different 20% of the data each time. Results,
using 700 MCMC iterations, are presented in Table 2. The

BEP outperforms the independent IBP model in both test
likelihood and error with a statistically significant difference. The independent IBP appears to have better results
in train error and likelihood, again suggesting overfitting.
Comparing the plots of the true measurements to the learnt
ones by the BEP and independent IBP model in Figure 5
we see that both models successfully reproduce the data
but the BEP reconstructions provide a cleaned up picture
of the meaningful signal.
The features found by the model in the different genome
locations correspond to different states associated with the
specific genome location. Genes and regulatory DNA elements such as enhancers, silencers and insulators are embedded in genomes. These genomic elements on the DNA
have footprints for the transacting proteins involved in transcription, either for the positioning or regulation of the transcriptional machinery. For instance, promoters are regions
of DNA which recruit proteins required to initiate transcription of a particular gene and located near the transcription
start sites. Enhancers are regions of DNA that can be bound
by proteins which activate transcription of a distal gene.
So a cell line, at specific genome location (recall that here
each location corresponds to 100 base pairs), will have underlying feature membership (some promoters and some
enhancer for example) that determines whether particular
protein are found there using ChIP-seq.
Genomic annotations, from ChromHMM (Ernst et al.,
2011), are shown in Figure 8 in the supplementary document for the region we model. Different levels of the marks
in these different regions are much easier to see in the reconstructed signal using BEP in Figure 5(b).

7. van de Bunt’s Dataset
In van de Bunt et al. (1999), 32 university freshman students in a given discipline at a Dutch university were surveyed at seven time points about who in their class they
considered as friends. Initially, i.e. t1 , most of the students
were unknown to each other. The first four time points are
three weeks apart, whereas the last three time points are six
weeks apart as showin in Figure 11 in the supplementary
matrial. We symmetrise the matrix by assuming friendship
if either individual reported it. We test the performance
of BEP using the sigmoid likelihood model as in Equation

We ran each model for 1000 MCMC iterations. The results are shown in Table 3. The independent network LFR
models outperform BEP in the train setting and the test error while BEP outperforms in the test likelihood. However, here the results are comparable. Looking at Figure
6, both models provide the same picture of the allocation.
It is possible the stationary assumption hurts the BEP: in
the VDB dataset the number of links almost exclusively increases over time.

Many modern machine learning and statistics tasks involve
multidimensional data positioned along some linear covariate: we have shown functional genomics data where the covariate is position in the genome, and network data where
links change over time. To model such data we need priors that utilize the dependencies through time, while handling high dimensionality. The BDFP is an expressive new
Bayesian non-parametric prior that fulfills these criteria. It
outputs time-evolving feature allocations, which can then
be effectively used to model high-dimensional time-series
data. Since the number of latent features is unbounded,
like other Bayesian non-parametric methods, the model
can adapt its complexity to the data. While the combinatorial BDFP may seem like a complex object to handle
computationally, our theoretical results showing that the de
Finetti measure underlying the BDFP is a specific beta process, which can be well approximated by a finite K model,
the BEP. Our experimental results, compared to independent feature allocations, provides evidence that effectively
modeling dependency in the feature allocation through the
birth-death mechanism is appropriate for a wide range of
statistical applications. Moreover, the BEP provides an interpretable structure using parameters not found, to the best
of our knowledge, in existing models, i.e. birth and death
rate of features. We are interested in scaling inference under the BEP to larger datasets, for example using (stochastic) variational inference methods that have been successful
for the IBP (Doshi et al., 2009).
