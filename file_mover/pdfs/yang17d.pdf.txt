Abstract

of this class: the variational autoencoder1 (VAE) (Kingma
& Welling, 2013).

Recent work on generative text modeling has
found that variational autoencoders (VAE) with
LSTM decoders perform worse than simpler
LSTM language models (Bowman et al., 2015).
This negative result is so far poorly understood,
but has been attributed to the propensity of
LSTM decoders to ignore conditioning information from the encoder. In this paper, we experiment with a new type of decoder for VAE:
a dilated CNN. By changing the decoder’s dilation architecture, we control the size of context from previously generated words. In experiments, we find that there is a trade-off between contextual capacity of the decoder and effective use of encoding information. We show
that when carefully managed, VAEs can outperform LSTM language models. We demonstrate
perplexity gains on two datasets, representing the
first positive language modeling result with VAE.
Further, we conduct an in-depth investigation of
the use of VAE (with our new decoding architecture) for semi-supervised and unsupervised labeling tasks, demonstrating gains over several
strong baselines.

The generative story behind the VAE (to be described in
detail in the next section) is simple: First, a continuous latent representation is sampled from a multivariate Gaussian. Then, an output is sampled from a distribution parameterized by a neural decoder, conditioned on the latent
representation. The latent representation (treated as a latent
variable during training) is intended to give the model more
expressive capacity when compared with simpler neural
generative models–for example, conditional language models. The choice of decoding architecture and final output
distribution, which connect the latent representation to output, depends on the kind of data being modeled. The VAE
owes its name to an accompanying variational technique
(Kingma & Welling, 2013) that has been successfully used
to train such models on image data (Gregor et al., 2015;
Salimans et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016).

1. Introduction
Generative models play an important role in NLP, both in
their use as language models and because of their ability
to effectively learn from unlabeled data. By parameterzing generative models using neural nets, recent work has
proposed model classes that are particularly expressive and
can pontentially model a wide range of phenomena in language and other modalities. We focus on a specific instance

The application of VAEs to text data has been far less successful (Bowman et al., 2015; Miao et al., 2016). The obvious choice for decoding architecture for a textual VAE
is an LSTM, a typical workhorse in NLP. However, Bowman et al. (2015) found that using an LSTM-VAE for text
modeling yields higher perplexity on held-out data than using an LSTM language model. In particular, they observe
that the LSTM decoder in VAE does not make effective
use of the latent representation during training and, as a result, VAE collapses into a simple language model. Related
work (Miao et al., 2016; Larochelle & Lauly, 2012; Mnih
& Gregor, 2014) has used simpler decoders that model text
as a bag of words. Their results indicate better use of latent representations, but their decoders cannot effectively
model longer-range dependencies in text and thus underperform in terms of final perplexity.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the
contextual capacity of the decoder plays an important role
in whether VAEs effectively condition on the latent representation when trained on text data. We propose the use
of a dilated CNN as a decoder in VAE, inspired by the recent success of using CNNs for audio, image and language

The name VAE is often used to refer to both a model class
and an associated inference procedure.

modeling (van den Oord et al., 2016a; Kalchbrenner et al.,
2016a; van den Oord et al., 2016b). In contrast with prior
work where extremely large CNNs are used, we exploit the
dilated CNN for its flexibility in varying the amount of conditioning context. In the two extremes, depending on the
choice of dilation, the CNN decoder can reproduce a simple MLP using a bags of words representation of text, or
can reproduce the long-range dependence of recurrent architectures (like an LSTM) by conditioning on the entire
history. Thus, by choosing a dilated CNN as the decoder,
we are able to conduct experiments where we vary contextual capacity, finding a sweet spot where the decoder can
accurately model text but does not yet overpower the latent
representation.
We demonstrate that when this trade-off is correctly managed, textual VAEs can perform substantially better than
simple LSTM language models, a finding consistent with
recent image modeling experiments using variational lossy
autoencoders (Chen et al., 2016). We go on to show that
VAEs with carefully selected CNN decoders can be quite
effective for semi-supervised classification and unsupervised clustering, outperforming several strong baselines
(from (Dai & Le, 2015)) on both text categorization and
sentiment analysis.
Our contributions are as follows: First, we propose the use
of a dilated CNN as a new decoder for VAE. We then empirically evaluate several dilation architectures with different
capacities, finding that reduced contextual capacity leads
to stronger reliance on latent representations. By picking a
decoder with suitable contextual capacity, we find our VAE
performs better than LSTM language models on two data
sets. We also explore the use of dilated CNN VAEs for
semi-supervised classification and find they perform better
than strong baselines from (Dai & Le, 2015). Finally, we
verify that the same framework can be used effectively for
unsupervised clustering.

2. Model
In this section, we begin by providing background on the
use of variational autoencoders for language modeling.
Then we introduce the dilated CNN architecture that we
will use as a new decoder for VAE in experiments. Finally,
we describe the generalization of VAE that we will use to
conduct experiments on semi-supervised classification.
2.1. Background on Variational Autoencoders
Neural language models (Mikolov et al., 2010) typically
generate each token xt conditioned on the entire history of
previously generated tokens:
Y
p(x) =
p(xt |x1 , x2 , ..., xt−1 ).
(1)
t

State-of-the-art language models often parametrize these
conditional probabilities using RNNs, which compute an
evolving hidden state over the text which is used to predict
each xt . This approach, though effective in modeling text,
does not explicitly model variance in higher-level properties of entire utterances (e.g. topic or style) and thus can
have difficulty with heterogeneous datasets.
Bowman et al. (2015) propose a different approach to generative text modeling inspired by related work on vision
(Kingma & Welling, 2013). Instead of directly modeling
the joint probability p(x) as in Equation 1, we specify a
generative process for which p(x) is a marginal distribution. Specifically, we first generate a continuous latent
vector representation z from a multivariate Gaussian prior
pθ (z), and then generate the text sequence x from a conditional distribution pθ (x|z) parameterized using a neural
net (often called the generation model or decoder). Because
this model incorporates a latent variable that modulates the
entire generation of each whole utterance, it may be better
able to capture high-level sources of variation in the data.
Specifically, in contrast with Equation 1, this generating
distribution conditions on latent vector representation z:
pθ (x|z) =

Y

pθ (xt |x1 , x2 , ..., xt−1 , z).

(2)

t

To estimate model parameters θ we would ideally
like
to maximize the marginal probability pθ (x) =
R
pθ (z)pθ (x|z)dz. However, computing this marginal is
intractable for many decoder choices. Thus, the following variational lower bound is often used as an objective
(Kingma & Welling, 2013):
Z
log pθ (x) = − log

pθ (z)pθ (x|z)dz

≥ Eqφ (z|x) [log pθ (x|z)] − KL(qφ (z|x)||pθ (z)).
Here, qφ (z|x) is an approximation to the true posterior (often called the recognition model or encoder) and is parameterized by φ. Like the decoder, we have a choice of neural architecture to parameterize the encoder. However, unlike the decoder, the choice of encoder does not change the
model class – it only changes the variational approximation
used in training, which is a function of both the model parameters θ and the approximation parameters φ. Training
seeks to optimize these parameters jointly using stochastic
gradient ascent. A final wrinkle of the training procedure
involves a stochastic approximation to the gradients of the
variational objective (which is itself intractable). We omit
details here, noting only that the final distribution of the
posterior approximation qφ (z|x) is typically assumed to be
Gaussian so that a re-parametrization trick can be used, and
refer readers to (Kingma & Welling, 2013).

2.2. Training Collapse with Textual VAEs
Together, this combination of generative model and variational inference procedure are often referred to as a variational autoencoder (VAE). We can also view the VAE
as a regularized version of the autoencoder. Note, however, that while VAEs are valid probabilistic models whose
likelihood can be evaluated on held-out data, autoencoders are not valid models. If only the first term of
the VAE variational bound Eqφ (z|x) [log pθ (x|z)] is used
as an objective, the variance of the posterior probability
qφ (z|x) will become small and the training procedure reduces to an autoencoder. It is the KL-divergence term,
KL(qφ (z|x)||pθ (z)), that discourages the VAE memorizing each x as a single latent point.
While the KL term is critical for training VAEs, historically, instability on text has been evidenced by the KL
term becoming vanishingly small during training, as observed by Bowman et al. (2015). When the training procedure collapses in this way, the result is an encoder that has
duplicated the Gaussian prior (instead of a more interesting posterior), a decoder that completely ignores the latent
variable z, and a learned model that reduces to a simpler
language model. We hypothesize that this collapse condition is related to the contextual capacity of the decoder
architecture. The choice encoder and decoder depends on
the type of data. For images, these are typically MLPs or
CNNs. LSTMs have been used for text, but have resulted in
training collapse as discussed above (Bowman et al., 2015).
Here, we propose to use a dilated CNN as the decoder instead. In one extreme, when the effective contextual width
of a CNN is very large, it resembles the behavior of LSTM.
When the width is very small, it behaves like a bag-ofwords model. The architectural flexibility of dilated CNNs
allows us to change the contextual capacity and conduct
experiments to validate our hypothesis: decoder contextual
capacity and effective use of encoding information are directly related. We next describe the details of our decoder.
2.3. Dilated Convolutional Decoders
The typical approach to using CNNs used for text generation (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016a) is similar to that used for
images (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016), but with
the convolution applied in one dimension. We take this
approach here in defining our decoder.
One dimensional convolution: For a CNN to serve as
a decoder for text, generation of xt must only condition
on past tokens x<t . Applying the traditional convolution
will break this assumption and use tokens x≥t as inputs
to predict xt . In our decoder, we avoid this by simply
shifting the input by several slots (van den Oord et al.,
2016b). With a convolution with filter size of k and using
n layers, our effective filter size (the number of past tokens

to condition to in predicting xt ) would be (k − 1) × n + 1.
Hence, the filter size would grow linearly with the depth of
the network.
Dilation: Dilated convolution (Yu & Koltun, 2015) was
introduced to greatly increase the effective receptive field
size without increasing the computational cost. With
dilation d, the convolution is applied so that d − 1 inputs
are skipped each step. Causal convolution can be seen
a special case with d = 1. With dilation, the effective
receptive size grows exponentially with network depth. In
Figure 1b, we show dilation of sizes of 1 and 2 in the first
and second layer, respectively. Suppose the dilation size in
the i-th layer is di and we use the same filter size
P k in all
layers, then the effective filter size is (k − 1) i di + 1.
The dilations are typically set to double every layer
di+1 = 2di , so the effective receptive field size can grow
exponentially. Hence, the contextual capacity of a CNN
can be controlled across a greater range by manipulating
the filter size, dilation size and network depth. We use this
approach in experiments.
Residual connection:
We use residual connection (He et al., 2016) in the decoder
to speed up convergence and enable
training of deeper models. We use
conv
a residual block (shown to the right)
conv
similar to that of (Kalchbrenner et al.,
2016a). We use three convolutional

layers with filter size 1×1, 1×k, 1×1,
respectively, and ReLU activation be+

can be approximated using:

Overall architecture: Our VAE architecture is shown in
Figure 1a. We use LSTM as the encoder to get the posterior probability q(z|x), which we assume to be diagonal
Gaussian. We parametrize the mean µ and variance σ with
LSTM output. We sample z from q(z|x), the decoder is
conditioned on the sample by concatenating z with every
word embedding of the decoder input.
2.4. Semi-supervised VAE
In addition to conducting language modeling experiments,
we will also conduct experiments on semi-supervised classification of text using our proposed decoder. In this section, we briefly review semi-supervised VAEs of (Kingma
et al., 2014) that incorporate discrete labels as additional
variables. Given the labeled set (x, y) ∼ DL and the unlabeled set x ∼ DU , (Kingma et al., 2014) proposed a model
whose latent representation contains continuous vector z
and discrete label y:
p(x, y, z) = p(y)p(z)p(x|y, z).

(3)

The semi-supervised VAE fits a discriminative network
q(y|x), an inference network q(z|x, y) and a generative
network p(x|y, z) jointly as part of optimizing a variational
lower bound similar that of basic VAE. For labeled data
(x, y), this bound is:

exp((log(πi ) + gi )/τ )
,
j=1 exp((log(πj ) + gj )/τ )

yi = Pc

(4)

where gi follows Gumbel(0, 1). The approximation is accurate when τ → 0 and smooth when τ > 0. In experiments,
we use Gumbel-Softmax to approximate the samples from
p(y|x) to reduce the computational cost. As a result, we
can directly back propagate the gradients of U (x) to the
discriminator network. We anneal τ so that sample variance is small when training starts and then gradually decrease τ .
Unsupervised clustering: In this section we adapt the
same framework for unsupervised clustering. We directly
minimize the objective U (x), which is consisted of two
parts: reconstruction loss and KL regularization on q(y|x).
The first part encourages the model to assign x to label y
such that the reconstruction loss is low. We find that the
model can easily get stuck in two local optimum: the KL
term is very small and q(y|x) is close to uniform distribution or the KL term is very large and all samples collapse
to one class. In order to make the model more robust, we
modify the KL term by:
KLy = max(γ, KL(q(y|x)|p(y)).

(5)

That is, we only minimize the KL term when it is large
enough.

log p(x, y) ≥ Eq(z|x,y) [log p(x|y, z)]
− KL(q(z|x, y)||p(z)) + log p(y)
=L(x, y) + log p(y).

3. Experiments

For unlabeled data x, the label is treated as a latent variable,
yielding:
log p(x) ≥U (x)

= Eq(y|x) Eq(z|x,y) [log p(x|y, z)]
− KL(q(z|x, y)||p(z)) + log p(y) − log q(y|x)
X
=
q(y|x)L(x, y) − KL(q(y|x)||p(y)).



y

Combining the labeled and unlabeled data terms, we have
the overall objective as:
J = E(x,y)∼DL [L(x, y)] + Ex∼DU [U (x)]
+ α E(x,y)∼DL [log q(y|x)],
where α controls the trade off between generative and discriminative terms.

(2016) propose a continuous approximation to sampling
from a categorical distribution. Let u be a categorical distribution with probabilities π1 , π2 , ..., πc . Samples from u

3.1. Data sets
Since we would like to investigate VAEs for language
modeling and semi-supervised classification, the data sets
should be suitable for both purposes. We use two large
scale document classification data sets: Yahoo Answer and
Yelp15 review, representing topic classification and sentiment classification data sets respectively (Tang et al., 2015;
Yang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015). The original data sets
contain millions of samples, of which we sample 100k as
training and 10k as validation and test from the respective
partitions. The detailed statistics of both data sets are in Table 1. Yahoo Answer contains 10 topics including Society
& Culture, Science & Mathematics etc. Yelp15 contains 5
level of rating, with higher rating better.

(NLL) and perplexity (PPL) on the test set. The KL component of NLL is given in parentheses. Size indicates the effective
filter size. VAE + init indicates pretraining of only the encoder using an LSTM LM.
3.2. Model configurations and Training details
We use an LSTM as an encoder for VAE and explore
LSTMs and CNNs as decoders. For CNNs, we explore several different configurations. We set the convolution filter
size to be 3 and gradually increase the depth and dilation
from [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] to [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 1, 2, 4, 8,
16]. They represent small, medium and large model and we
name them as SCNN, MCNN and LCNN. We also explore
a very large model with dilations [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16] and name it as VLCNN. The effective
filter size are 15, 63, 125 and 187 respectively. We use the
last hidden state of the encoder LSTM and feed it though an
MLP to get the mean and variance of q(z|x), from which
we sample z and then feed it through an MLP to get the
starting state of decoder. For the LSTM decoder, we follow (Bowman et al., 2015) to use it as the initial state of
LSTM and feed it to every step of LSTM. For the CNN decoder, we concatenate it with the word embedding of every
decoder input.
The architecture of the Semi-supervised VAE basically follows that of the VAE. We feed the last hidden state of the
encoder LSTM through a two layer MLP then a softmax
to get q(y|x). We use Gumbel-softmax to sample y from
q(y|x). We then concatenate y with the last hidden state of
encoder LSTM and feed them throught an MLP to get the
mean and variance of q(z|y, x). y and z together are used
as the starting state of the decoder.
We use a vocabulary size of 20k for both data sets and set
the word embedding dimension to be 512. The LSTM dimension is 1024. The number of channels for convolutions

in CNN decoders is 512 internally and 1024 externally, as
shown in Section 2.3. We select the dimension of z from
[32, 64]. We find our model is not sensitive to this parameter.
We use Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) to optimize all models
and the learning rate is selected from [2e-3, 1e-3, 7.5e-4]
and β1 is selected from [0.5, 0.9]. Empirically, we find
learning rate 1e-3 and β1 = 0.5 to perform the best. We
select drop out ratio of LSTMs (both encoder and decoder)
from [0.3, 0.5]. Following (Bowman et al., 2015), we also
use drop word for the LSTM decoder, the drop word ratio
is selected from [0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]. For the CNN decoder,
we use a drop out ratio of 0.1 at each layer. We do not
use drop word for CNN decoders. We use batch size of
32 and all model are trained for 40 epochs. We start to
half the learning rate every 2 epochs after epoch 30. Following (Bowman et al., 2015), we use KL cost annealing
strategy. We set the initial weight of KL cost term to be
0.01 and increase it linearly until a given iteration T . We
treat T as a hyper parameter and select it from [10k, 40k,
80k].
3.3. Language modeling results
The results for language modeling are shown in Table 2.
We report the negative log likelihood (NLL) and perplexity
(PPL) of the test set. For the NLL of VAEs, we decompose
it into reconstruction loss and KL divergence and report the
KL divergence in the parenthesis. To better visualize these
results, we plot the results of Yahoo data set (Table 2a) in
Figure 2.

For VAE, we decompose the loss into reconstruction loss
and KL divergence, shown in blue and red respectively. We
subtract all loss values with 300 for better visualization.

We first look at the LM results for Yahoo data set. As
we gradually increase the effective filter size of CNN from
SCNN, MCNN to LCNN, the NLL decreases from 345.3,
338.3 to 335.4. The NLL of LCNN-LM is very close to
the NLL of LSTM-LM 334.9. But VLCNN-LM is a little bit worse than LCNN-LM, this indicates a little bit of
over-fitting.
We can see that LSTM-VAE is worse than LSTM-LM in
terms of NLL and the KL term is nearly zero, which verifies
the finding of (Bowman et al., 2015). When we use CNNs
as the decoders for VAEs, we can see improvement over
pure CNN LMs. For SCNN, MCNN and LCNN, the VAE
results improve over LM results from 345.3 to 337.8, 338.3
to 336.2, and 335.4 to 333.9 respectively. The improvement is big for small models and gradually decreases as we
increase the decoder model contextual capacity. When the
model is as large as VLCNN, the improvement diminishes
and the VAE result is almost the same with LM result. This
is also reflected in the KL term, SCNN-VAE has the largest
KL of 13.3 and VLCNN-VAE has the smallest KL of 0.7.
When LCNN is used as the decoder, we obtain an optimal trade off between using contextual information and latent representation. LCNN-VAE achieves a NLL of 333.9,
which improves over LSTM-LM with NLL of 334.9.
We find that if we initialize the parameters of LSTM encoder with parameters of LSTM language model, we can
improve the VAE results further. This indicates better
encoder model is also a key factor for VAEs to work
well. Combined with encoder initialization, LCNN-VAE
improves over LSTM-LM from 334.9 to 332.1 in NLL and
from 66.2 to 63.9 in PPL. Similar results for the sentiment
data set are shown in Table 2b. LCNN-VAE improves over
LSTM-LM from 362.7 to 359.1 in NLL and from 42.6 to
41.1 in PPL.

we can see that documents of different topics fall into different clusters, while in Figure 3b, documents of different

Motivated by the success of VAEs for language modeling,
we continue to explore VAEs for semi-supervised learning.
Following that of (Kingma et al., 2014), we set the number
of labeled samples to be 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 respectively.
Ablation Study: At first, we would like to explore the
effect of different decoders for semi-supervised classification. We fix the number of labeled samples to be 500 and
report both classification accuracy and NLL of the test set
of Yahoo data set in Table. 5. We can see that SCNN-VAESemi has the best classification accuracy of 65.5. The accuracy decreases as we gradually increase the decoder contextual capacity. On the other hand, LCNN-VAE-Semi has
the best NLL result. This classification accuracy and NLL
trade off once again verifies our conjecture: with small contextual window size, the decoder is forced to use the encoder information, hence the latent representation is better

Model

Comparing the NLL results of Table 5 with that of Table 2a, we can see the NLL improves. The NLL of semisupervised VAE improves over simple VAE from 337.8 to
335.7 for SCNN, from 336.2 to 332.8 for MCNN, and from
333.9 to 332.8 for LCNN. The improvement mainly comes
from the KL divergence part, this indicates that better latent representations decrease the KL divergence, further
improving the VAE results.

Comparison with related methods: We compare Semisupervised VAE with the methods from (Dai & Le, 2015),
which represent the previous state-of-the-art for semisupervised sequence learning. Dai & Le (2015) pre-trains
a classifier by initializing the parameters of a classifier with
that of a language model or a sequence autoencoder. They
find it improves the classification accuracy significantly.
Since SCNN-VAE-Semi performs the best according to Table 5, we fix the decoder to be SCNN in this part. The
detailed comparison is in Table 4. We can see that semisupervised VAE performs better than LM-LSTM and LALSTM from (Dai & Le, 2015). We also initialize the encoder of the VAE with parameters from LM and find classification accuracy further improves. We also see the advantage of SCNN-VAE-Semi over LM-LSTM is greater when
the number of labeled samples is smaller. The advantage
decreases as we increase the number of labeled samples.
When we set the number of labeled samples to be 25k,
the SCNN-VAE-Semi achieves an accuracy of 70.4, which
is similar to LM-LSTM with an accuracy of 70.5. Also,
SCNN-VAE-Semi performs better on Yahoo data set than
Yelp data set. For Yelp, SCNN-VAE-Semi is a little bit
worse than LM-LSTM if the number of labeled samples is
greater than 100, but becomes better when we initialize the
encoder. Figure 3b explains this observation. It shows the
documents are coupled together and are harder to classify.
Also, the latent representation contains information other
than sentiment, which may not be useful for classification.
3.5. Unsupervised clustering results
We also explored using the same framework for unsupervised clustering. We compare with the baselines that ex-

tract the feature with existing models and then run Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) on these features. We find empirically that simply using the features does not perform well
since the features are high dimensional. We run a PCA on
these features, the dimension of PCA is selected from [8,
16, 32]. Since GMM can easily get stuck in poor local optimum, we run each model ten times and report the best
result. We find directly optimizing U (x) does not perform
well for unsupervised clustering and we need to initialize
the encoder with LSTM language model. The model only
works well for Yahoo data set. This is potentially because
Figure 3b shows that sentiment latent representations does
not fall into clusters. γ in Equation 5 is a sensitive parameter, we select it from the range between 0.5 and 1.5 with
an interval of 0.1. We use the following evaluation protocol (Makhzani et al., 2015): after we finish training, for
cluster i, we find out the validation sample xn from cluster i that has the best q(yi |x) and assign the label of xn
to all samples in cluster i. We then compute the test accuracy based on this assignment. The detailed results are
in Table 5. We can see SCNN-VAE-Unsup + init performs
better than other baselines. LSTM+GMM performs very
bad probably because the feature dimension is 1024 and is
too high for GMM, even though we already used PCA to
reduce the dimension.
Conditional text generation With the semi-supervised
VAE, we are able to generate text conditional on the label. Due to space limitation, we only show one example of

4. Related work
Variational inference via the re-parameterization trick was
initially proposed by (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende
et al., 2014) and since then, VAE has been widely adopted
as generative model for images (Gregor et al., 2015; Yan
et al., 2016; Salimans et al., 2015; Gregor et al., 2016; Hu
et al., 2017b).
Our work is in line with previous works on combining
variational inferences with text modeling (Bowman et al.,
2015; Miao et al., 2016; Serban et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,
2016; Hu et al., 2017a). (Bowman et al., 2015) is the first
work to combine VAE with language model and they use
LSTM as the decoder and find some negative results. On
the other hand, (Miao et al., 2016) models text as bag of
words, though improvement has been found, the model can
not be used to generate text. Our work fills the gaps between them. (Serban et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) applies variational inference to dialogue modeling and machine translation and found some improvement in terms of
generated text quality, but no language modeling results are
reported. (Chung et al., 2015; Bayer & Osendorfer, 2014;
Fraccaro et al., 2016) embedded variational units in every
step of a RNN, which is different from our model in using
global latent variables to learn high level features.
Our use of CNN as decoder is inspired by recent success of
PixelCNN model for images (van den Oord et al., 2016b),
WaveNet for audios (van den Oord et al., 2016a), Video
Pixel Network for video modeling (Kalchbrenner et al.,
2016b) and ByteNet for machine translation (Kalchbrenner
et al., 2016a). But in contrast to those works showing using
a very deep architecture leads to better performance, CNN
as decoder is used in our model to control the contextual
capacity, leading to better performance.
Our work is closed related the recently proposed variational
lossy autoencoder (Chen et al., 2016) which is used to pre-

dict image pixels. They find that conditioning on a smaller
window of a pixels leads to better results with VAE, which
is similar to our finding. Much (Rezende & Mohamed,
2015; Kingma et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016) has been done
to come up more powerful prior/posterior distribution representations with techniques such as normalizing flows. We
treat this as one of our future works. This work is largely
orthogonal and could be potentially combined with a more
effective choice of decoder to yield additional gains.
There is much previous work exploring unsupervised sentence encodings, for example skip-thought vectors (Kiros
et al., 2015), paragraph vectors (Le & Mikolov, 2014), and
sequence autoencoders (Dai & Le, 2015). (Dai & Le, 2015)
applies a pretrained model to semi-supervised classification
and find significant gains, we use this as the baseline for our
semi-supervised VAE.

5. Conclusion
We showed that by controlling the decoder’s contextual capacity in VAE, we can improve performance on both language modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks by
preventing a degenerate collapse of the training procedure.
These results indicate that more carefully characterizing
decoder capacity and understanding how it relates to common variational training procedures may represent important avenues for unlocking future unsupervised problems.
