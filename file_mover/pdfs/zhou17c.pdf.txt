Abstract
Many studies in biomedical and health sciences
involve small sample sizes due to logistic or financial constraints. Often, identifying weak (but
scientifically interesting) associations between
a set of predictors and a response necessitates
pooling datasets from multiple diverse labs or
groups. While there is a rich literature in statistical machine learning to address distributional
shifts and inference in multi-site datasets, it is
less clear when such pooling is guaranteed to
help (and when it does not) – independent of the
inference algorithms we use. In this paper, we
present a hypothesis test to answer this question,
both for classical and high dimensional linear regression. We precisely identify regimes where
pooling datasets across multiple sites is sensible, and how such policy decisions can be made
via simple checks executable on each site before
any data transfer ever happens. With a focus on
Alzheimer’s disease studies, we present empirical results showing that in regimes suggested by
our analysis, pooling a local dataset with data
from an international study improves power.

1. Introduction
In the last two decades, statistical machine learning algorithms for processing massive datasets have been intensively studied for a wide-range of applications in computer
vision, biology, chemistry and healthcare (Murdoch & Detsky, 2013; Tarca et al., 2007). While the challenges posed
by large scale datasets are compelling, one is often faced
with a fairly distinct set of technical issues for studies in biological and health sciences. For instance, a sizable portion

of scientific research is carried out by small or mediumsized groups (Fortin & Currie, 2013) supported by modest
budgets (Lauer, 2016). Hence, there are logistic/financial
constraints on the number of experiments and/or number
of participants within a trial, leading to small size datasets.
While the analysis may be sufficiently powered to evaluate the primary hypothesis of the study/experiment, interesting follow-up scientific questions (often more nuanced),
come up during the course of the project. These tasks may
be underpowered for the sample sizes available. This necessitates efforts to identify similar datasets elsewhere so
that the combined sample size of the “pooled” dataset is
enough to determine significant associations between a response and a set of predictors, e.g., within linear regression.
Motivating Application. In genomics, funding agencies
have invested effort into standardizing/curating data collection across large international projects (ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2004). In other disciplines, such as in the
study of neurological disorders, heterogeneity in disease
etiology, variations in scanners and/or acquisition tools
make standardization more difficult. For Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a motivation of this work, efforts such as ADNI
(Weiner et al., 2015) provide a variety of clinical, imaging
and cognitive tests data for 800+ older adults. However,
the research focus has now moved to the early stages of
disease – as early as late middle age – where treatments are
expected to be more effective. But (a) the statistical signal at this stage is weak and difficult to demonstrate without large sample sizes and (b) such “preclinical” participants are not well represented, even in large ADNI sized
studies. Hence, there is a concerted effort in general for
smaller standalone projects (focused on a specific disease
stage), that can be retrospectively pooled for analysis towards addressing a challenging scientific hypothesis (Jahanshad et al., 2013). Unfortunately, acquisition protocols
for various measures across sites are usually different and
data are heterogeneous. These issues raise a fundamental
technical question. When is it meaningful to pool datasets
for estimating a simple statistical model (e.g., linear regression)? When can we guarantee improvements in statistical
power, and when are such pooling efforts not worth it? Can
we give a hypothesis test and obtain p-values to inform our
policies/decisions? While related problems have been stud-

ied in machine learning from an algorithm design perspective, even simple hypothesis tests which can be deployed
by a researcher in practice, are currently unavailable. Our
goal is to remove this significant limitation.
Putting our development in context. The realization that
“similar” datasets from multiple sites can be pooled to potentially improve statistical power is not new. With varying
empirical success, models tailored to perform regression
in multi-site studies (Group, 2002), (Haase et al., 2009),
(Klunk et al., 2015) have been proposed, where due to operational reasons, recruitment and data acquisition are distributed over multiple sites, or even countries. When the
pooling is being performed retrospectively (i.e., after the
data has been collected), resolving site-specific confounds,
such as distributional shifts or biases in measurements, is
essential before estimation/inference of a statistical model.
We will not develop new algorithms for estimating the distributional mismatch or for performing multi-site regression — rather, our primary goal is to identify the regimes
(and give easily computable checks) where this regression
task on a pooled dataset is statistically meaningful, assuming that good pre-processing schemes are available. We
will present a rigorous yet simple to implement hypothesis
test, analyze its behavior, and show extensive experimental
evidence (for an important scientific problem). The practitioner is free to use his/her preferred procedure for the
“before step” (estimating the distributional shifts).
Contributions: a) Our main result is a hypothesis test to
evaluate whether pooling data across multiple sites for regression (before or after correcting for site-specific distributional shifts) can improve the estimation (mean squared
error) of the relevant coefficients (while permitting an influence from a set of confounding variables). b) We derive analogous results in the high-dimensional setting by
leveraging a different set of analysis techniques. Using
an existing sparse multi-task Lasso model, we show how
the utility of pooling can be evaluated even when the support set of the features (predictors) is not exactly the same
across sites using ideas broadly related to high dimensional
simultaneous inference (Dezeure et al., 2015). We show
`2 -consistency rate, which supports the use of sparse multitask Lasso when sparsity patterns are not totally identical.
c) On an important scientific problem of analyzing early
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) individuals, we provide compelling experimental results showing consistent acceptance
rate and statistical power. Via a publicly available software package, this will facilitate many multi-site regression
analysis efforts in the short to medium term future.
1.1. Related Work
Meta-analysis approaches. If datasets at multiple different sites cannot be shared or pooled, the task of deriving

meaningful scientific conclusions from results of multiple
independently conducted analyses generally falls under the
umbrella term of “meta analysis”. The literature provides
various strategies to cumulate the general findings from
analyses on different datasets. But even experts believe
that, minor violations of assumptions can lead to misleading scientific conclusions (Greco et al., 2013), and substantial personal judgment (and expertise) is needed to conduct
them. It is widely accepted that when the ability to pool the
data is an option, simpler schemes may perform better.
Domain adaptation/shift. Separately, the idea of addressing “shift” within datasets has been rigorously studied within statistical machine learning, see (Patel et al.,
2015; Li, 2012). For example, domain adaptation, including dataset and covariate shift, seeks to align (the distributions of) multiple datasets to enable follow-up processing (Ben-David & Schuller, 2003). Typically, such algorithms assume a bias in the sampling process, and adopt reweighting as the solution (Huang et al., 2007; Gong et al.,
2013). Alternatively, a family of such methods assume
that sites (or datasets) differ due to feature distortions (e.g.,
calibration error), which are resolved, in general, by minimizing some distance measure between appropriate distributions (Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2011;
Long et al., 2015; Ganin et al., 2016). In general, these approaches have nice theoretical properties (Ben-David et al.,
2010; Cortes & Mohri, 2011; Zhou et al., 2016). However,
it is important to note that the domain adaptation literature
focuses on the algorithm itself – to resolve the distributional site-wise differences. It does not address the issue
of whether pooling the datasets, after applying the calculated adaptation (i.e., transformation), is beneficial. Our
goal in this work is to assess whether multiple datasets can
be pooled — either before or usually after applying the best
domain adaptation methods — for improving our estimation of the relevant coefficients within linear regression. We
propose a hypothesis test to directly address this question.
The high-dimensional case. High dimensional scenarios, in general, involve predicting a response (e.g., cognitive score) from high dimensional predictors such as image
scans (or derived features) and genetic data, which in general, entails Lasso-type formulations unlike the classical regression models. Putting multi-task representation learning
(Maurer et al., 2016; Ando & Zhang, 2005; Maurer et al.,
2013) together with a sparsity regularizer, we get the multitask Lasso model (Liu et al., 2009; Kim & Xing, 2010).
Although this seems like a suitable model (Chen et al.,
2012), it assumes that the multiple tasks (sites here) have an
identical active set of predictors. Instead, we find that the
sparse multi-task Lasso (Lee et al., 2010), roughly, a multitask version of sparse group Lasso (Simon et al., 2013; Lee
et al., 2010) is a better starting point. There is no theoretical
analysis in (Simon et al., 2013); although a `2 -consistency

When can Multi-Site Datasets be Pooled for Regression?

for sparse group lasso is derived in (Chatterjee et al., 2012)
using a general proof procedure for M-estimators, it does
not take into account the specific sparse group Lasso properties. This makes the result non-informative for sparse
group Lasso (much less, sparse multi-task Lasso). Specifically, as we will see shortly, in sparse multi-task Lasso,
the joint effects of two penalties induces a special type of
asymmetric structure. We show a new result, in the style
of Lasso (Meinshausen & Yu, 2009; Liu & Zhang, 2009b),
for `2 convergence rate for this model. It matches known
results for Lasso/group Lasso, and identifies regimes where
the sparse multi-task (multi-site) setting is advantageous.
Simultaneous High dimensional Inference. Simultaneous high dimensional inference models such as multi
sample-splitting and de-biased Lasso is an active research
topic in statistics (Dezeure et al., 2015). Multi samplesplitting use half of the dataset for variable selection and
the rest for calculating p-values. De-biased Lasso chooses
one feature as a response and the others as predictors to
estimate a Lasso model; this procedure is repeated for
each feature. Estimators from De-biased Lasso asymptotically follow the multi-normal distribution (Dezeure et al.,
2016), and using Bonferroni-Holm adjustment produces
simultaneous p-values. Such ideas together with the `2 convergence results for sparse multitask Lasso, will help
extend our analysis to the high dimensional setting.

sion is well-known. The mean-squared
error (MSE) of (1)

is Ekβ̂ − β ∗ k22 = tr (X T X)−1 σ 2 . If k denotes the
number of sites, then one may first apply a domain adaptation scheme to account for the distributional shifts between the k different predictors {Xi }ki=1 , and then run a
regression model. If the underlying “concept” (i.e., predictors and responses relationship) can be assumed to be the
same across the different sites, then it is reasonable to impose the same β for all sites. For instance, the influence of
CSF protein measurements on cognitive scores of an individual may be invariant to demographics. Nonetheless, if
the distributional mismatch correction is imperfect, we may
define ∆βi = βi − β ∗ where i ∈ {1, . . . , k} as the residual difference between the site-specific coefficients and the
true shared coefficient vector (in the ideal case, we have
∆βi = 0). In the multi-site setting, we can write

where for each site i we have yi = Xi β ∗ + Xi ∆βi + i and
i ∼ N (0, σi2 ) I . I . D. Here, τi is a weighting parameter
for each site, if such information is available.
Our main goal is to test if the combined regression improves the estimation for a single site. We can pose this
question in terms of improvements in the mean squared error (MSE). Hence, W. L . O . G . using site 1 as the reference,
we set τ1 = 1 in (2) and consider β ∗ = β1 ,

2. Hypothesis Test for Multi-Site Regression
We first describe a simple setting where one seeks to apply standard linear regression to data pooled from multiple
sites. For presentation purposes, we will deal with variable selection issues later. Within this setup, we will introduce our main result — a hypothesis test to evaluate
statistical power improvements (e.g., mean squared error)
when running a regression model on a pooled dataset. We
will see that the proposed test is transparent to the use of
adaptation algorithms, if any, to pre-process the multi-site
data (more details in appendix). In later sections, we will
present convergence analysis and extensions to the large
p setting. Matrices (vectors/scalars) are upper case (and
lower case). k.k∗ is the nuclear norm.
We first introduce the single-site regression model. Let
X ∈ Rn×p and y ∈ Rn×1 denote the feature matrix of
predictors and the response vector respectively. If β corresponds to the coefficient vector (i.e., predictor weights),

These ideas are nicely studied within papers devoted to the
“bias-variance” trade-off. Similar to these results, we will
focus on the mean squared error because the asymptotic
consistency properties that come with an unbiased estimator are not meaningful here anyway — the key reason we
want to pool datasets in the first place is because of small
sample sizes. We now provide a result showing how the
tuning parameters τ2 , . . . , τk can be chosen.

Theorem 2.1 τi =

achieves the smallest variance in β̂.

Remarks: This result follows from observing that the each
site’s contribution is inversely proportional to site-specific
noise level, σi . We will show that this choice of τi s also
leads to a simple mechanism to setup a hypothesis test.
2.1. Sharing all βs
In the specification above, the estimates of βi across all k
sites are restricted to be the same. Without this constraint,
(3) is equivalent to fitting a regression separately on each
site. So, a natural question is whether this constraint improves estimation. To evaluate whether MSE is reduced,
we first need to quantify the change in the bias and variance of (3) compared to (1). To do so, we introduce a few
notations. Let ni be the sample size of site i, and let β̂i
denote the regression estimate from a specific site i. We
have ∆β̂i = β̂i − β̂1 . We define the length kp vector ∆β T
as ∆β T = (∆β2T , ..., ∆βkT ) (similarly for ∆β̂ T ). We use
Σ̂i for the sample covariance matrix of the data (predictors)
from the site i and G ∈ R(k−1)p×(k−1)p for the covariance
matrix of ∆β̂, where Gii = (n1 Σ̂1 )−1 + (ni τi2 Σ̂i )−1 and
Gij = (n1 Σ̂1 )−1 whenever i 6= j.
Let the difference in bias and variance between the single
site model in (1) and the multi-site model in (3) be Biasβ
Pk
and V arβ respectively. Let Σ̂k2 = i=2 ni τi2 Σ̂i and Σ̂k1 =
n1 Σ̂1 + Σ̂k2 . We have,

Remarks: This is our main test result. Although σi is typically unknown, it can be easily replaced using its sitespecific estimation. Theorem 2.3 implies that we can conduct a non-central χ2 distribution test based on the statistic. Also, (6) shows that the non-central χ2 distribution,
which the test statistics will follow, has a non-central parameter smaller than 1 when the sufficient condition H0
holds. Meanwhile, in obtaining the (surprisingly simple)
sufficient condition H0 , no other arbitrary assumption is
needed except the application of Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. From a practical perspective, Theorem 2.3 implies that
the sites, in fact, do not even need to share the full dataset
to assess whether pooling will be useful. Instead, the test
only requires very high-level information such as β̂i , Σ̂i ,
σi and ni for all participating sites – which can be transferred very cheaply with no additional cost of data storage,
or privacy implications. The following result deals with the
special case where we have two participating sites.
Corollary 2.4 For the case where we have two participating sites, the condition (6) from Theorem 2.3 reduces to
H0 : ∆β T ((n1 Σ̂1 )−1 + (n2 τ22 Σ̂2 )−1 )−1 ∆β ≤ σ12 . (8)
Remarks: The left side above relates to the Mahalanobis
distance between β1 , β2 with covariance (n1 Σ̂1 )−1 +
(n2 τ22 Σ̂2 )−1 , implying that the test statistic is a type of a
normalized metric between the two regression models.

Remarks: The above result bounds the increase in bias and
the reduction in variance (see discussion of Figure 1). Since
our goal is to test MSE reduction — in principle, we can use
bootstrapping to calculate MSE approximately. This procedure has a significant computational footprint. Instead, (4)
(from a one-step Cauchy-Schwartz inequality), gives a sufficient condition for MSE reduction as shown below.
Theorem 2.3 a) Model (3) has smaller MSE of β̂ than
model (1) whenever
H0 : kG−1/2 ∆βk22 ≤ σ12 .

In numerous pooling scenarios, we are faced with certain
systemic differences in the way predictors and responses
associate across sites. For example, socio-economic status may (or may not) have a significant association with a
health outcome (response) depending on the country of the
study (e.g., due to insurance coverage policies). Unlike in
Section 2.1, we now relax the restriction that all coefficients
are the same across sites, see Fig. 2. The model in (3) will
now include another design matrix of predictors Z ∈ Rn×q
and corresponding coefficients γi for each site i,

Our goal is still to evaluate whether the MSE of β reduces.
We do not take into account the MSE change in γ because
they correspond to site-specific variables. For estimation,
β̂ can first be computed from (9). Treating it as a fixed entity now, γ̂i can be computed using yi and Zi on each site
independently. Clearly, if β̂ is close to the “true” β ∗ , it will
also enable a better estimation of site-specific variables. It
turns out that, if Σ̂i s are replaced by the conditional covariance, the analysis from Section 2.1 still holds for this case.

Specifically, let Σ̂abi be the sample covariance matrix between features a and b from some site i. We have,
Theorem 2.5 Analysis in Section 2.1 holds for β in (9) by
replacing Σ̂i with Σ̃i = Σ̂xxi − Σ̂xzi (Σ̂zzi )−1 Σ̂zxi
Remarks: The test now allows evaluating power improvements focused only on the subset of coefficients that is
shared and permits site-specific confounds. For example,
we can test which subset of parameters might benefit from
parameter estimation on pooled data from multiple sites.

3. Pooling in High Dimensional Regression

3.1. `2 consistency

We now describe our analysis of pooling multi-site data in
the high-dimensional setting where p  n. The challenge
here is that variable section has to be a first order concern.
In classical regression, `2 consistency properties are well
known and so our focus in Section 2 was devoted to deriving sufficient conditions for the hypothesis test. In other
words, imposing the same β across sites works in (3) because we understand its consistency. In contrast, here, one
cannot enforce a shared β for all sites before the active set
of predictors within each site are selected — directly imposing the same β leads to a loss of `2 -consistency, making
follow-up analysis problematic. Therefore, once a suitable
model for high-dimensional multi-site regression is chosen,
the first requirement is to characterize its consistency.
We start with the multi-task Lasso (a special case of group
Lasso) (Liu et al., 2009), where the authors show that the
strategy selects better explanatory features compared to
separately fitting Lasso on each site. But this algorithm underperforms when the sparsity pattern of the predictors is
not identical across sites, so we use a recent variant called
sparse multi-task Lasso (Lee et al., 2010) – essentially substituting “sites” for “tasks”. The sparse multi-site Lasso in
p  n setting (p is the number of predictors) is given as

Our analysis of (11) is related to known results for Lasso
(Meinshausen & Yu, 2009) and the group Lasso (Liu &
Zhang, 2009a). Recall that X1 , . . . , Xk are the data matrices from k sites. We define n̄ = maxki=1 {ni } and
C = n̄−1 DIAG(X1T X1 , ..., XkT Xk ) where DIAG(A, B)
corresponds to constructing a block-diagonal matrix with
A and B as blocks on the diagonal. We require the following useful properties of C (k·k0 denotes `0 -norm).
Definition 3.1 The m-sparse minimal and maximal eigenvalues of C, denoted by φmin (m) and φmax (m), are

We call a feature “active” if its coefficient is non-zero.
Now, each site may have different active features: let
sh ≤ kp be the sum of the number of active features over
all sites. Similarly, sp is the cardinality of the union of features that are active in at least one site (sh ≤ ksp , sp ≤ p).
Recall that when α 6= 0, we add the Lasso penalty to the
multi-site Lasso penalty. When the sparsity patterns are assumed to be similar across all sites, α is small. In contrast,
to encourage site-specific sparsity patterns, we may set α
to be large. We now analyze these cases independently.

be used shortly); a larger α weighs the `1 penalty more and
a smaller α puts more weight on the grouping. Similar to a
Lasso-based regularization parameter, λ here will produce
a solution path (to select coefficients) for a given α. We
first address the consistency behavior of the sparse multisite Lasso in (11), which was not known in the literature.

When can Multi-Site Datasets be Pooled for Regression?

Remarks: The above result agrees with known results for
multi-task Lasso (Liu et al., 2009; Liu & Zhang, 2009b)
when the sparsity patterns are the same across sites. The
simplest way to interpret Theorem 3.2 is via the ratio r =
sh
sp . Here, r = k when the sparsity patterns are the same
across sites. As r decreases, the sparsity patterns across
sites start to differ, in turn, the sparse multi-site Lasso
from (11) will provide stronger consistency compared to
the multi-site Lasso (which corresponds to α = 0). In other
words, whenever we expect site-specific active features, the
`2 consistency of (11) will improve as one includes an additional `1 -penalty together with multi-site Lasso.

hand, for sparse
√ β , kβ k1 has the same scale as kβ k2 ,
i.e., with no k penalization (see appendix). Unlike Theorem 3.2 where the sparsity patterns across sites are similar, due to this scaling issue, the parameters α and λ need
to be ‘corrected’ for the setting where sparsity patterns
have little overlap. We denote these
√corrected versions by
α̃ = (1−α)α√k+α and λ̃ = ((1 − α) k + α)λ.

Remarks: This result agrees with known results for Lasso
(Meinshausen & Yu, 2009) when the sparsity patterns are
completely different across sites. In this case (i.e., α is
large), the sparse multi-site Lasso has stronger consistency
compared to Lasso (α = 1). The sparse multi-site Lasso is
preferable as r = sshp increases. Note that although α̃ and
λ̃ are used for the results instead of α and λ, in practice,
one can simply scale the chosen αs appropriately, e.g., with
k = 100, we see that α ≈ 0.99 corresponds to α̃ = 0.95.
Performing hypothesis tests: Theorems 3.2 and 3.3
show consistency of sparse multi-site Lasso estimation.
Hence, if the hyper-parameters α and λ are known, we
can estimate the coefficients B ∗ . This variable selection
phase can be followed by a hypothesis test, similar to Theorem 2.3 from Section 2. The only remaining issue is the
choice of α. The existing methods show that joint crossvalidation for α and λ performs unsatisfactorily and instead
use a heuristic: set it to 0.05 when it is known that sparsity

patterns are similar across sites and 0.95 otherwise (Simon
et al., 2013). Below, instead of a fixed α, we provide a
data-driven alternative that works well in practice.
Choosing α using simultaneous inference: Our results
in Thm. 3.2 (and Thm. 3.3 resp.) seem to suggest that
increasing (and decreasing resp.) α will always improve
consistency; however, this ends up requiring stronger msparsity conditions. We now describe a procedure to choose
α. First, recall that an active feature corresponds to a variable with non-zero coefficient. We call a feature “siteactive” if it is active at a site, an “always-active” feature
is active at all k sites. The proposed solution involves three
steps. (1) First, we apply simultaneous inference (like multi
sample-splitting or de-biased Lasso) using all features at
each of the k sites with FWER control. This step yields
“site-active” features for each site, and therefore, gives the
set of always-active features and the sparsity patterns. (2)
Then, each site runs a Lasso and chooses a λi based on
cross-validation. We then set λmulti−site to be the minimum among the best λ’s from each site. Using λmulti−site ,
we can vary α to fit various sparse multi-site Lasso models – each run will select some number of always-active
features. We plot α versus the number of always-active
features. (3) Finally, based on the sparsity patterns from
the site-active set, we estimate whether the sparsity patterns across sites are similar or different (i.e., share few active features). Then, based on the plot from step (2), if the
sparsity patterns from the site-active sets are different (similar) across sites, then the smallest (largest) value of α that
selects the minimum (maximum) number of always-active
features is chosen. The appendix includes details.

4. Experiments
Our experiments are two-fold. First we perform simulations evaluating the hypothesis test from §2 and sparse
multi-site Lasso from §3. We then evaluate pooling two
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) datasets from different studies
to evaluate improvements in power, and checking whether
the proposed tests provide insights into the regimes when
pooling is beneficial for regression, and will yield tangible
statistical benefits in investigating scientific hypotheses.
Power and Type I Error of Theorem 2.3: The first set
of simulations evaluate the setting from Section 2.1 where
the coefficients are same across two different sites. The
inputs for the two sites are set as X1 , X2 (∈ Rn×3 ) ∼
N (0, Σ) with Σ = 0.5(I + E) (where I is identity and E
is a 3 × 3 matrix of 1s). The true coefficients are given by
β1 ∼ U (0, 4I) and β2 = β1 + 0.1 (where U (·) is multivariate uniform), and the noise corresponds to 1 ∼ N (0, 3I)
and 2 ∼ N (0, 0.5I) for the two sites respectively. With
this design, the responses are set as y1 = X1 β1 + 1 and
y2 = X2 β2 + 2 . Using {X1 , y1 } and {X2 , y2 }, the shared

β̂ are estimated. The simulation is repeated 100 times with
9 different sample sizes (n = 2b with b = 4, . . . , 12) for
each repetition. Fig. 3(a) shows the MSE of two-site (blue
bars) and a baseline single-site (red bars) model computed
using the corresponding β̂s on site 1. Although both MSEs
decrease as n increases, the two-sites model consistently
produces smaller MSE – with large gains for small sample
sizes (left-end of Fig. 3(a)). Fig. 3(d) shows the acceptance rates of our proposed hypothesis test (from (6) and
(8)) with 0.05 significance level. The purple solid line is
the sufficient condition from Theorem 2.3, while the dotted line is where the MSE of the baseline single-site model
starts to decrease below that of the two-site model. The
trend in Fig. 3(d) implies that as n increases, the test tends
to reject pooling the multi-site data with power → 1. Further, the type I error is well-controlled to the left of the
solid line, and is low between the two lines. See appendix
for additional details about Figs. 3(a,d).
Power and Type I Error of Theorem 2.5: The second set of simulations evaluate the confounding variables setup from Section 2.2. Similar to Section 4, here
we have (X1 , Z1 ), (X2 , Z2 ) ∼ N (0, Σ) with
Σ =


0.5I3×3 + 0.5E3×3 ,
0.2E3×5
. β1 and
0.2E5×3 ,
0.8I5×5 + 0.2E5×5
β2 are the same as before. γ1 = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2)T and
γ2 = (2, 2, 2, 1, 1)T are the coefficients for Z1 and Z2 respectively. The new responses y1 and y2 will have the extra
terms Z1 γ1 and Z2 γ2 respectively. Fig. 3(b,e) shows the
results. All the observations from Fig. 3(a,d) hold here as
well. For small n, MSE of two-site model is much smaller
than baseline, and as sample size increases this difference
reduces. The test accepts with high probability for small n,
and as sample size increases it rejects with high power. The
regimes of low type I error and high power in Fig. 3(e) are
similar to those from Fig. 3(d).
4.1. Sparse multi-sites Lasso `2 -consistency
We now use 4 sites with n = 150 samples each and p =
400 features to test the sparse multi-site model from §3.
We set the design matrices Xi (i = 1, . . . , 4) ∼ N (0, Σ)
with Σ = 0.8Ip×p + 0.2Ep×p . We consider the two cases
(sparsity patterns shared/not shared) separately.
Few sparsity patterns shared: 6 shared features and 14
site-specific features (out of the 400) are set to be active in
4 sites. Each shared feature is sampled from U (0, 4) for
the first two sites and U (0, 0.5) for the rest. All the sitespecific features are ∼ U (0, 4). The noise i ∼ N (0, 1),
and the responses are yi = Xi βi + i . Fig. 3(c) shows
the 10-fold cross validation error as λ changes (i.e., solution path) for different α settings, including the value
from our proposed selection procedure (from Section 3.1),
Lasso (α = 1), group Lasso (α = 0) and arbitrary values α = 0.05, 0.95 (as suggested by (Simon et al., 2013)).

Our chosen α = 0.97 (the blue curve in Fig. 3(c)) has
the smallest error, across all λs, thereby implying a better `2 consistency. Table 1 in the appendix includes more
details, including α = 0.97 discovers more always-active
features, while preserving the ratio of correctly discovered
active features to all the discovered ones.
Most sparsity patterns shared: Unlike the earlier case,
here we set 16 shared and 4 site-specific features (both
∼ U (0, 4)) to be active among all 400 features. The result,
shown in Fig. 3(f), is similar to Fig. 3(c). The proposed
choice of α = 0.25 competes favorably with alternate
choices while preserving the correctly discovered number
of always-active features. Unlike the previous case, the ratio of correctly discovered active features to all discovered
ones increases here (see appendix).
4.2. Combining AD datasets from multiple sites
We now evaluate whether two AD datasets acquired at different sites – an Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimage Initiative
(ADNI) dataset and a local dataset from Wisconsin ADRC
(ADlocal) can be combined (appendix has dataset details).
The sample sizes are 318 and 156 respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels are the inputs, and the
response is hippocampus volume. Using 81 age-matched
samples from each dataset, we first perform domain adaptation (using a maximum mean discrepancy objective as
a measure of distance between the two marginals), and
then transform CSF proteins from ADlocal to match with
ADNI. The transformed data is then used to evaluate
whether adding ADlocal data to ADNI will improve the
regression performed on the ADNI data. This is done by
training a regression model on the ‘transformed’ ADlocal
and a subset of ADNI data, and then testing the resulting
model on the remaining ADNI samples. We use two baseline models each of which are trained using – ADNI data
alone; and non-transformed ADlocal (with ADNI subset).
Fig. 4(a,b) show the resulting mean prediction error (MPE)
scaled by the estimated noise level in ADNI responses, and
the corresponding acceptance rate (with significance level
0.05) respectively. The x-axis in Fig. 4(a,b) represents
the size of ADNI subset used for training. As expected,
the MPE reduces as this subset size increases. Most importantly, pooling after transformation (green bars) seems
to be the most beneficial in terms of MPE reduction. As
shown in Fig. 4(a), to the left of purple line where the
subset size is smaller than ADlocal datasize, pooling the
datasets improves estimation. This is the small sample size
regime which necessitates pooling efforts in general. As
the dataset size increases (to the right of x-axis in Fig. 4(a))
the resulting MPE for the pooled model is close to what we
will achieve using the ADNI data by itself.
Since pooling after transformation is at least as good as us-

acceptance rates for (a,c). Unlike in (a), (c) restricts same training data size for ADNI and ADlocal.

ing ADNI data alone, our hypothesis test accepts the combination with high rate (≈ 95%), see Fig. 4(b). The test
rejects the pooling strategy with high power for combining before domain adaptation (see Fig. 4(b)), as one would
expect. This rejection power increases rapidly as sample
size increases, see red curve in Fig. 4(b). The results in
Fig. 4(c,d) show the setting where one cannot change the
dataset sizes at the sites i.e., the training set uses an equal
number of labeled samples from both the ADNI and ADlocal (x-axis in Fig. 4(c)), and the testing set always corresponds to 20% of ADNI data. This is a more interesting
scenario for a practitioner compared to Fig. 4(a,b), because
in Fig. 4(c,d) we use same sample sizes for both datasets.
The trends in Fig. 4(c,d) are the same as Fig. 4(a,b).

5. Conclusions
We present a hypothesis test to answer whether pooling
multiple datasets acquired from different sites is guaran-

teed to increase statistical power for regression models.
For both standard and high dimensional linear regression,
we identify regimes where such pooling is sensible, and
show how such policy decisions can be made via simple
checks executable on each site before any data transfer ever
happens. We also show empirical results by combining
two Alzheimer’s disease datasets in the context of different
regimes proposed by our analysis, and see that the regression fit improves as suggested by the theory. The code is
available at https://github.com/hzhoustat/ICML2017.
